The project has been plagued with problems. After the first 12 helicopters were delivered to the U.S. Army, two crashed. The remaining 10 were grounded until it could be determined what caused the crashes. This was not the first instance when a mechanical or design problem interfered with the deployment of these aircraft. Henderson Aircraft employs nearly 4,700 workers and is the largest employer in Big Bend, Kansas, and the surrounding region.\n3 days after the helicopters were grounded, Sean O’Grady, a reporter for the Big Bend Bulletin, received a call from Madison who said he wanted to talk with the reporter. At the meeting, Madison told O’Grady that he would tell him what was wrong with the new helicopters in exchange for a promise not to reveal his identity. Madison said he was a loyal employee of Henderson Aircraft, but that this helicopter seemed to have 1 problem after another. Someday soon, Madison said, a pilot is going to be killed because of the faulty design. Madison said that his 23-year-old son is a U.S. Army helicopter pilot, and that he was fearful that his son might end up flying one of these defective aircraft. After O’Grady agreed to protect Madison’s identity, the manager revealed that the problem in the aircraft was a substandard rotor blade. Madison said that the company bought the blades from an unlicensed and disreputable manufacturer that uses cheaper metal in fabricating the rotor blades. Henderson Aircraft was trying to save money by buying the cheaper blades because development costs for the helicopter were higher than they expected.\nO’Grady told his editor about Madison’s allegations and was assigned to write the story. Late in the day, Big Bend Bulletinpublisher, Kate Jackson, heard about the story and immediately ordered the editor to not write the story. She explained that Henderson Aircraft would be seriously harmed by the story and that the company is too important to the local economy for theBulletin to publish the story. A story like the one Madison told O’Grady would anger Henderson Aircraft, its employees, and many readers who rely on the Henderson payroll to keep their own businesses going, Jackson said. The editor and O’Grady protested. After a discussion, Jackson agreed to publish a modified version of O’Grady’s story. She insisted that the source of the allegations about the rotor blades be named in the story. She said O’Grady must also point out that Oscar Madison is only a midlevel manager at Henderson, someone who might not really understand what is going on. Jackson said she believed this would lower the credibility of the news report and make it easier for Henderson to deny the allegations. Faced with no story or with using the name of the source, O’Grady agreed to name his source.\nFollowing publication of the story, a spokesperson at Henderson denied that there was any problem with the rotor blades. A week later, the company fired Oscar Madison, ostensibly because of an unfavorable annual evaluation. Madison, who has a large mortgage, 2 children in college, and other financial obligations, sued the Bulletin for revealing his name after promising not to.\nWrite a 525- to 700-word response that addresses the following questions about the case study:\n\nWhat type of lawsuit would Oscar Madison most likely file?\nWhat will Madison have to prove to the court to win his case?\nIs it likely that Madison will win?

Then, your best friend became a victim of a crime of violence after being stalked for several months, and that incident changed your life. As you provided comfort and support to your friend during the judicial process, you were exposed first hand to the role played by the victims' witness assistant during the criminal judicial process. The role of the victims' witness assistant changed you, and you decided then that you wanted to pursue a career as a victims' rights advocate somewhere. It has been a year since you were able to start your career in the victims' rights advocate position, and every day, you feel that you are making a difference in society and your jurisdiction. \nThe prosecutor for whom you have been working as a victims' witness assistant has had several calls from victims of stalking. Some cases seem more serious than other cases; however, one case that no one in the office thought was serious resulted in the victim’s death. Everyone thought that the couple was just going through a difficult breakup. This case had a tremendous impact on the entire office, especially you.\nTo help make sure that the office does not minimize a potentially dangerous situation again, the prosecutor has asked you to put together an intake, evaluation, and assessment instrument to be used in taking information on stalking situations. Be sure to check stalking statutes, and cite the elements of the crime of stalking in your documents. \n\nIn 2-3 pages, complete the following:\n\nCreate a topic paper (2–3 pages) in APA format discussing the following: \n    \nImportance of recognizing the signs of stalking \nCriminal definition of stalking for your jurisdiction (cite a relevant stalking statute) \nKey facts that you felt all office personnel should know about stalking, such as the remedies designed to help a stalking victim \n\n\nCreate an intake form in addition to the topic paper that can be used to get important information from alleged victims of stalking. \n    \nThe form should require information about the nature and frequency of stalking and should determine if the elements of the crime of stalking are present. \nThe form should also ask questions that will elicit answers that help indicate what type of stalking situation exists, asking things such as: Is the victim acquainted with the suspect, and if so, how? If not, how does the victim think the suspect knows or has encountered the victim? It should ask for the frequency of the annoyance and if the victim is in fear and why. Most stalking statutes require a pattern of harassment or annoyance that would make a reasonable person afraid or seriously annoyed; the form should ask something that would capture that information. The form should indicate whether or not there is a pending divorce or other legal matters between the 2 parties. \n\n\nCreate an evaluation and assessment form in addition to the topic paper based on the intake form you have created that will help rank the seriousness of the threat from the suspect who is stalking. \n    \nThe evaluation and assessment form should indicate your familiarity with the contemporary information on what constitutes the most dangerous threat to the victim and then provide a ranking accordingly. \n\n\nYour forms should reflect contemporary information, the legal definition of the crime of stalking, and the factors that distinguish the most serious situations.\n\nFor more information on creating PowerPoint presentations, visit the Microsoft Office Applications Lab.  Use the library, Internet, and other resources available to you to conduct your research.

The project has been plagued with problems. After the first 12 helicopters were delivered to the U.S. Army, two crashed. The remaining 10 were grounded until it could be determined what caused the crashes. This was not the first instance when a mechanical or design problem interfered with the deployment of these aircraft. Henderson Aircraft employs nearly 4,700 workers and is the largest employer in Big Bend, Kansas, and the surrounding region.\n3 days after the helicopters were grounded, Sean O’Grady, a reporter for the Big Bend Bulletin, received a call from Madison who said he wanted to talk with the reporter. At the meeting, Madison told O’Grady that he would tell him what was wrong with the new helicopters in exchange for a promise not to reveal his identity. Madison said he was a loyal employee of Henderson Aircraft, but that this helicopter seemed to have 1 problem after another. Someday soon, Madison said, a pilot is going to be killed because of the faulty design. Madison said that his 23-year-old son is a U.S. Army helicopter pilot, and that he was fearful that his son might end up flying one of these defective aircraft. After O’Grady agreed to protect Madison’s identity, the manager revealed that the problem in the aircraft was a substandard rotor blade. Madison said that the company bought the blades from an unlicensed and disreputable manufacturer that uses cheaper metal in fabricating the rotor blades. Henderson Aircraft was trying to save money by buying the cheaper blades because development costs for the helicopter were higher than they expected.\nO’Grady told his editor about Madison’s allegations and was assigned to write the story. Late in the day, Big Bend Bulletinpublisher, Kate Jackson, heard about the story and immediately ordered the editor to not write the story. She explained that Henderson Aircraft would be seriously harmed by the story and that the company is too important to the local economy for theBulletin to publish the story. A story like the one Madison told O’Grady would anger Henderson Aircraft, its employees, and many readers who rely on the Henderson payroll to keep their own businesses going, Jackson said. The editor and O’Grady protested. After a discussion, Jackson agreed to publish a modified version of O’Grady’s story. She insisted that the source of the allegations about the rotor blades be named in the story. She said O’Grady must also point out that Oscar Madison is only a midlevel manager at Henderson, someone who might not really understand what is going on. Jackson said she believed this would lower the credibility of the news report and make it easier for Henderson to deny the allegations. Faced with no story or with using the name of the source, O’Grady agreed to name his source.\nFollowing publication of the story, a spokesperson at Henderson denied that there was any problem with the rotor blades. A week later, the company fired Oscar Madison, ostensibly because of an unfavorable annual evaluation. Madison, who has a large mortgage, 2 children in college, and other financial obligations, sued the Bulletin for revealing his name after promising not to.\nWrite a 525- to 700-word response that addresses the following questions about the case study:\n\nWhat type of lawsuit would Oscar Madison most likely file?\nWhat will Madison have to prove to the court to win his case?\nIs it likely that Madison will win?

Then, your best friend became a victim of a crime of violence after being stalked for several months, and that incident changed your life. As you provided comfort and support to your friend during the judicial process, you were exposed first hand to the role played by the victims' witness assistant during the criminal judicial process. The role of the victims' witness assistant changed you, and you decided then that you wanted to pursue a career as a victims' rights advocate somewhere. It has been a year since you were able to start your career in the victims' rights advocate position, and every day, you feel that you are making a difference in society and your jurisdiction. \nThe prosecutor for whom you have been working as a victims' witness assistant has had several calls from victims of stalking. Some cases seem more serious than other cases; however, one case that no one in the office thought was serious resulted in the victim’s death. Everyone thought that the couple was just going through a difficult breakup. This case had a tremendous impact on the entire office, especially you.\nTo help make sure that the office does not minimize a potentially dangerous situation again, the prosecutor has asked you to put together an intake, evaluation, and assessment instrument to be used in taking information on stalking situations. Be sure to check stalking statutes, and cite the elements of the crime of stalking in your documents. \n\nIn 2-3 pages, complete the following:\n\nCreate a topic paper (2–3 pages) in APA format discussing the following: \n    \nImportance of recognizing the signs of stalking \nCriminal definition of stalking for your jurisdiction (cite a relevant stalking statute) \nKey facts that you felt all office personnel should know about stalking, such as the remedies designed to help a stalking victim \n\n\nCreate an intake form in addition to the topic paper that can be used to get important information from alleged victims of stalking. \n    \nThe form should require information about the nature and frequency of stalking and should determine if the elements of the crime of stalking are present. \nThe form should also ask questions that will elicit answers that help indicate what type of stalking situation exists, asking things such as: Is the victim acquainted with the suspect, and if so, how? If not, how does the victim think the suspect knows or has encountered the victim? It should ask for the frequency of the annoyance and if the victim is in fear and why. Most stalking statutes require a pattern of harassment or annoyance that would make a reasonable person afraid or seriously annoyed; the form should ask something that would capture that information. The form should indicate whether or not there is a pending divorce or other legal matters between the 2 parties. \n\n\nCreate an evaluation and assessment form in addition to the topic paper based on the intake form you have created that will help rank the seriousness of the threat from the suspect who is stalking. \n    \nThe evaluation and assessment form should indicate your familiarity with the contemporary information on what constitutes the most dangerous threat to the victim and then provide a ranking accordingly. \n\n\nYour forms should reflect contemporary information, the legal definition of the crime of stalking, and the factors that distinguish the most serious situations.\n\nFor more information on creating PowerPoint presentations, visit the Microsoft Office Applications Lab.  Use the library, Internet, and other resources available to you to conduct your research.

In ",":body0":"Analyzing Descriptive Statistics\nAs a practicing scholar, you are searching for evidence to translate into practice. In your review of the evidence, you locate a quantitative descriptive research study as possible evidence to support a practice change. You notice the sample of this study includes 200 participants and is not normally distributed. Reflect upon this scenario to address the following.\nWhat statistical procedure is needed to determine an effective sample size to make a reasonable conclusion? Explain your rationale.\nThe most appropriate statistical procedure for determining if the sample size is effective is the T-test. It compares the mean of two groups to determine the difference and inform if the control group's population is effective to test the hypothesis. It determines whether the experiment affects the target population (Mishra et al., 2019). A t-test is valid as long as the sample size is enough to determine the test statistic.\nReading through the study, you observe that the researcher used chi-square analysis to analyze nominal and ordinal data. Is this the appropriate level of statistical analysis to answer the research question? Explain your rationale.\nThe use of chi-square is appropriate when analyzing categorical data, and when the test statistic is chi-squared distributed under the null hypothesis. It can easily determine the research's reliability by giving the same answer when the rows and columns of the chi-square are rearranged.\nReading further, the researcher reports that the p-level led her to conclude that the null hypothesis was rejected. In your critique of the study, you determine that the null hypothesis is true. Do these findings impact your decision about whether to use this evidence to inform practice change? Why or why not?\nSince the researcher concluded that the null hypothesis is not true, yet the findings reveal that it is true, it shows that the research has credibility issues. These findings will impact my decision on whether to use this evidence or not. Good research should be valid and reliable, making it easy to transfer the evidence in the practical world. Research with such errors may not be reliable and therefore influences implementation.\nIs especially important for us, to learn the correct use of the different research tools. Research plays a critical role in problem-solving because it generates useful knowledge and information that can be used to address societal problems. People research to generate new knowledge related o particular societal problems (Weith et al., 2019).\nReferences\nMishra, P., Pandey, C. M., Singh, U., Gupta, A., Sahu, C., & Keshri, A. (2019).

To turn in your work you will need to scan it in and created a PDF file (please send a copy of the original work as well so I can see what you were trying to copy). You are not being graded on your artwork rather on your ability to describe your experience in two to three paragraphs. Talk about how you were feeling prior to the exercise, during it and when it was done. Comment on what you think of this exercise in creativity and relaxation, how it felt to actually do the drawing, how you felt during and after the inverted drawing exercise. Note how you were feeling, what your brain was doing and engaged in before, during and after the exercise. \nAccording to Kalat for almost all right handed people and more than 60% of left handers, the left hemisphere of the brain controls speech while the right hemisphere is responsible for spatial relationships such as what an object would look like if it was rotated. The left brain is verbal, logical, rational and analytical while the right brain deals with images, patterns, dreams, analogies and new ideas. Because of this difference in processing, the right brain is more conducive to the relaxation response (Davis, Eshelman, McKay, 2000). \nUsing the imaginative and creative part of the brain can be relaxing. This exercise is adapted from The Relaxation & Stress Reduction Workbook (pg 58).I used this exercise in a Stress and Coping course. This exercise draws on the theory and work by Betty Edwards an art teacher and researcher (see the vase-face exercise on the moodle site). She forces her students to shift from thinking about a drawing exercise to intuiting the drawing exercise by asking them to draw the image upside down.\nThe inverted drawing exercise is designed to cognitively shift you from labeling, logical, rational mode to a nonverbal, visual, intuitive mode the left brain can’t process. After the inverted drawing exercise, according to Edwards, “students reported less time urgency, less attachment to meaning, and a heightened sense of alertness, while feeling relaxed, calm, confident and exhilarated.”  \n  \nFind a quiet place to draw where you will not be disturbed. Play music if you like. Choose a drawing that interests you from an art book. Turn the drawing upside down and begin to copy what you see. Do not turn the drawing right side up until you have completed your artwork. Finish the drawing in one time period allow at least 35-40 minutes. Set a timer if this helps.\nTo begin:\nLook at the inverted drawing for a minute and take in the lines, angles and shapes. You can see how it fits together, when you draw start at the top and copy each line, moving from line to line, putting it together like a puzzle. Do not name parts as you draw. Take your time, line to line, don’t make the exercise hard. Allow your movements to be easy and slow. \nAfter you’ve finished drawing, take a moment to recognize how you feel and your state of mind. Do you feel calm and relaxed? Did you lose track of time, were you able to turn off the left brain chatter? Did you allow yourself to not label the parts, or judge and criticize your work? Now turn the drawing right side up and see how you did.

Then, your best friend became a victim of a crime of violence after being stalked for several months, and that incident changed your life. As you provided comfort and support to your friend during the judicial process, you were exposed first hand to the role played by the victims' witness assistant during the criminal judicial process. The role of the victims' witness assistant changed you, and you decided then that you wanted to pursue a career as a victims' rights advocate somewhere. It has been a year since you were able to start your career in the victims' rights advocate position, and every day, you feel that you are making a difference in society and your jurisdiction. \nThe prosecutor for whom you have been working as a victims' witness assistant has had several calls from victims of stalking. Some cases seem more serious than other cases; however, one case that no one in the office thought was serious resulted in the victim’s death. Everyone thought that the couple was just going through a difficult breakup. This case had a tremendous impact on the entire office, especially you.\nTo help make sure that the office does not minimize a potentially dangerous situation again, the prosecutor has asked you to put together an intake, evaluation, and assessment instrument to be used in taking information on stalking situations. Be sure to check stalking statutes, and cite the elements of the crime of stalking in your documents. \n\nIn 2-3 pages, complete the following:\n\nCreate a topic paper (2–3 pages) in APA format discussing the following: \n    \nImportance of recognizing the signs of stalking \nCriminal definition of stalking for your jurisdiction (cite a relevant stalking statute) \nKey facts that you felt all office personnel should know about stalking, such as the remedies designed to help a stalking victim \n\n\nCreate an intake form in addition to the topic paper that can be used to get important information from alleged victims of stalking. \n    \nThe form should require information about the nature and frequency of stalking and should determine if the elements of the crime of stalking are present. \nThe form should also ask questions that will elicit answers that help indicate what type of stalking situation exists, asking things such as: Is the victim acquainted with the suspect, and if so, how? If not, how does the victim think the suspect knows or has encountered the victim? It should ask for the frequency of the annoyance and if the victim is in fear and why. Most stalking statutes require a pattern of harassment or annoyance that would make a reasonable person afraid or seriously annoyed; the form should ask something that would capture that information. The form should indicate whether or not there is a pending divorce or other legal matters between the 2 parties. \n\n\nCreate an evaluation and assessment form in addition to the topic paper based on the intake form you have created that will help rank the seriousness of the threat from the suspect who is stalking. \n    \nThe evaluation and assessment form should indicate your familiarity with the contemporary information on what constitutes the most dangerous threat to the victim and then provide a ranking accordingly. \n\n\nYour forms should reflect contemporary information, the legal definition of the crime of stalking, and the factors that distinguish the most serious situations.\n\nFor more information on creating PowerPoint presentations, visit the Microsoft Office Applications Lab.  Use the library, Internet, and other resources available to you to conduct your research.

He reduced the political culture of the United States into three basic types: moralistic (think New England), traditionalistic (think Alabama) and individualistic (think Montana).\nTexas is seen as a hybrid of traditionalistic and individualistic cultures, which makes sense. Texas is a huge state, geographically, and is amazingly diverse. It's history is part pre-civil war plantation (East Texas) part cowboy (West Texas), and is closely connected, geographically and culturally, to Mexico.\nI think Houston is really hard to squeeze into one category. Houston is the largest city in the United States to have no zoning ordinance. Houstonians prefer to let property owners, rather than local governments, decide what they can and can't do on their property. Houston elected the first openly-lesbian mayor in 2009, and she was reelected twice without serious opposition. Wendy Davis, a very liberal Democratic candidate for governor, carried the City of Houston in 2014 despite losing by a huge margin statewide. Houstonians voted 60-40 a year later to repeal an \"equal rights\" ordinance that would have created special protections for gay, lesbian and transgender Houstonians, then voted a month after that to elect a more liberal Sylvester Turner mayor over the more conservative Bill King. In 2018, underfunded Democratic candidate Lupe Valdez won a majority of Houston votes while losing by nearly 14 percentage points statewide. Houston's at-large (city-wide) council elections have been won by conservative Republicans (Mike Knox), liberal Democrats (Sue Lovell), Latinos (Orlando Sanchez), African-Americans (Amanda Edwards), Asians (Gordon Quan), and nearly every other type of Houstonian.\nIs Houston more individualistic or traditionalistic? Or is it something else entirely? Does it fit into any of Dr. Elazar's categories?\nWrite a 2 - 5 page (double-spaced, normal font no bigger than 12, normal margins, etc) college-level essay telling me about Houston's political culture.

How much he charges I'm not sure, but the price is worth it if it keeps him off the streets and out of another movie. \"Deuce Bigalow\" is aggressively bad, as if it wants to cause suffering to the audience. The best thing about it is that it runs for only 75 minutes.  \nRob Schneider is back, playing a male prostitute (or, as the movie reminds us dozens of times, a \"man whore\"). He is not a gay hustler, but specializes in pleasuring women, although the movie's closest thing to a sex scene is when he wears diapers on orders from a giantess. Oh, and he goes to dinner with a woman with a laryngectomy, who sprays wine on him through her neck vent.\nThe plot: Deuce visits his friend T.J. Hicks (Eddie Griffin) in Amsterdam, where T.J. is a pimp specializing in man-whores. Business is bad, because a serial killer is murdering male prostitutes, and so Deuce acts as a decoy to entrap the killer. In his investigation he encounters a woman with a penis for a nose. You don't want to know what happens when she sneezes.\nDoes this sound like a movie you want to see? It sounds to me like a movie that Columbia Pictures and the film's producers (Glenn S. Gainor, Jack Giarraputo, Tom McNulty, Nathan Talbert Reimann, Adam Sandler and John Schneider) should be discussing in long, sad conversations with their inner child.\nThe movie created a spot of controversy last February. According to a story by Larry Carroll of MTV News, Rob Schneider took offense when Patrick Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times listed this year's Best Picture Nominees and wrote that they were \"ignored, unloved and turned down flat by most of the same studios that ... bankroll hundreds of sequels, including a follow-up to 'Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,' a film that was sadly overlooked at Oscar time because apparently nobody had the foresight to invent a category for Best Running Penis Joke Delivered by a Third-Rate Comic.\"\nSchneider retaliated by attacking Goldstein in full-page ads in Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter. In an open letter to Goldstein, Schneider wrote: \"Well, Mr. Goldstein, I decided to do some research to find out what awards you have won. I went online and found that you have won nothing. Absolutely nothing. No journalistic awards of any kind ... Maybe you didn't win a Pulitzer Prize because they haven't invented a category for Best Third-Rate, Unfunny Pompous Reporter Who's Never Been Acknowledged by His Peers.\nReading this, I was about to observe that Schneider can dish it out but he can't take it. Then I found he's not so good at dishing it out, either. I went online and found that Patrick Goldstein has won a National Headliner Award, a Los Angeles Press Club Award, a RockCritics.com award, and the Publicists' Guild award for lifetime achievement.\nSchneider was nominated for a 2000 Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor, but lost to Jar-Jar Binks.\nBut Schneider is correct, and Patrick Goldstein has not yet won a Pulitzer Prize. Therefore, Goldstein is not qualified to complain that Columbia financed \"Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo\" while passing on the opportunity to participate in \"Million Dollar Baby,\" \"Ray,\" \"The Aviator,\" \"Sideways\" and \"Finding Neverland.\" As chance would have it, I have won the Pulitzer Prize, and so I am qualified. Speaking in my official capacity as a Pulitzer Prize winner, Mr. Schneider, your movie sucks.\n\nQuestion 2:\nI have no idea why Rob Reiner, or anyone else, wanted to make this story into a movie, and close examination of the film itself is no help. \"North\" is one of the most unpleasant, contrived, artificial, cloying experiences I've had at the movies. To call it manipulative would be inaccurate; it has an ambition to manipulate, but fails.\nThe film stars Elijah Wood, who is a wonderful young actor (and if you don't believe me, watch his version of \"The Adventures of Huck Finn\"). Here he is stuck in a story that no actor, however wonderful, however young, should be punished with. He plays a kid with inattentive parents, who decides to go into court, free himself of them, and go on a worldwide search for nicer parents.\nThis idea is deeply flawed. Children do not lightly separate from their parents - and certainly not on the evidence provided here, where the great parental sin is not paying attention to their kid at the dinner table. The parents (Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Jason Alexander) have provided little North with what looks like a million-dollar house in a Frank Capra neighborhood, all on dad's salary as a pants inspector. And, yes, I know that is supposed to be a fantasy, but the pants-inspecting jokes are only the first of several truly awful episodes in this film.\nNorth goes into court, where the judge is Alan Arkin, proving without the slightest shadow of a doubt that he should never, ever appear again in public with any material even vaguely inspired by Groucho Marx. North's case hits the headlines, and since he is such an all-star overachiever, offers pour in from would-be parents all over the world, leading to an odyssey that takes him to Texas, Hawaii, Alaska, and elsewhere.\nWhat is the point of the scenes with the auditioning parents? (The victimized actors range from Dan Aykroyd as a Texan to Kathy Bates as an Eskimo). They are all seen as broad, desperate comic caricatures. They are not funny. They are not touching. There is no truth in them. They don't even work as parodies. There is an idiocy here that seems almost intentional, as if the filmmakers plotted to leave anything of interest or entertainment value out of these episodes.\nNorth is followed on his travels by a mysterious character who appears in many guises. He is the Easter bunny, a cowboy, a beach bum, and a Federal Express driver who works in several product plugs.\nFunny, thinks North; this guy looks familiar. And so he is. All of the manifestations are played by Bruce Willis, who is not funny, or helpful, in any of them.\nI hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it.\nI hold it as an item of faith that Rob Reiner is a gifted filmmaker; among his credits are \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" \"The Sure Thing,\" \"The Princess Bride,\" \"Stand By Me,\" \"When Harry Met Sally...,\" and \"Misery.\" I list those titles as an incantation against this one.\n\"North\" is a bad film - one of the worst movies ever made.

Many companies use extensive resources to ensure that their employees gain the skills, knowledge, and experience required to produce positive outcomes. Additionally, according to Elnaga and Imran (2013), employees who undergo training and development programs bring about more desirable results than those who do not receive any training. For this reason, employee training and development is an essential process in organizations. However, firms' means and methods to provide training and development programs are sometimes ineffective due to various. In this sense, the company has decided to introduce a technology aspect that will be significant in training employees.\nThe new technology changes in the company involve applying microlearning as a training and development technique for all employees. In recent years, technological changes have focused on improving different areas in the workplace, including training and development. Hall (2021) explains that microlearning is the most recent technological trend for providing employees with learning and development programs. Our company decided to introduce microlearning because it believes the employees will gain more from this technology than the current training methods. Microlearning involves a modern technological advancement that allows employees to learn new skills in bits, ensuring they optimize the lessons. Therefore, the microlearning technology change is essential and significant for employees that require training and development.\nAccounting for Personality Differences\nIn every team, each individual displays a different personality from the others. The difference in personalities may create problems such as lack of understanding, discrepant response to situations, and comprehension of matters at hand. However, there are several ways I can account for the difference in personalities. First, I would ensure I build a relationship with all the team members because connecting as a team makes it easier to work with different personalities. Secondly, understanding what the team members consider important to them is another way that I will account for the personality differences. These two ways can help me manage the team's differences in personality.\nEncouraging the Members to Challenge Input\nSeveral ways can help me encourage members to ask relevant questions and challenge input from others. For example, I can encourage members to ask questions by leading by example. Leaders who ask questions influence their followers and team members to ask questions regarding issues that have been discussed. Secondly, I have to provide a listening ear to members when they are contributing to the discussion to encourage them to ask questions further. Additionally, giving them time to contribute or challenge others' points will be good for encouraging them.\nAligning the Team around the Final Decision\nAll members of a team need to be in agreement before a final decision is made. However, in some cases, members may fail to agree on certain things, which leads to a final decision based on the majority or the leader. In such cases, I will have to explain to the members that the decision had to be made. Despite some of them not agreeing with me, we could present the best decision as a team. Therefore, I will have to explain to the disagreeing members why I settled for the final decision and how it impacts the changes.\nReferences\nElnaga, A., & Imran, A. (2013).

The change impacted the way our Territory Sales Managers (TSM) schedule virtual customer contacts. The change was to reduce clicks and allow TSM's to gain access to customer information faster. I am our team's SalesForce Super User. My responsibilities include rollout and demonstration of new features. The new process was not received favorably by all TSM's which created several challenges.\n\nPersonality differences within our team generated differing acceptance levels of the change. According to Andrew Martins, there are four generations currently in the workforce (Boomers, Gen X, Millenials, Gen Z) (1). My teammate Lisa who has been with the company going on 25 years, was not fond of the scheduling process changes. Lisa tends to be somewhat set in her ways and resistant to change. I took the approach of overselling the benefits and rationale for the differences in hopes of gaining Lisa's buy-in. I also made myself available to her to answer questions after our demo call. According to my DiSC Assessment, I tend to focus on maintaining stability to get results (2). I believed in the stability that the change within our CRM would create for our multiple workstreams, and thankfully I was able to sell Lisa on it as well.\n\nTo ensure the team that their voice and opinions mattered and foster a healthy discussion about changes, I opened the call by asking several questions and soliciting feedback. In my experience, questioning effectively helps get the conversation started. I asked each teammate for their opinions individually. Had I read this week's lecture prior to our call, I could have reinforced that disagreements, when managed well, can have positive outcomes (JWI505, 3).\n\nFinally, to align the team around the final decision, I again reinforced the rationale and benefits of our CRM change. I also made myself available for follow-up after the call. TSM feedback is always welcome and is the driving force behind most SalesForce enhancements and new features; with that in mind, I reinforced that point and set a date for a follow-up call to debrief pain points after testing the new process for two weeks. Stay tuned; the follow-up call is this Thursday.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Andrew Martins. 2019. Team Communication Remains A Pain Point for US Workers. Business News Daily Staff\n\n2.

Spark your imagination and create an original logo, advertisement, banner, poster, or other visual image using your artistic skills and persuade a company or organization to adopt your image. In your letter, analyze your image’s shape, symbolism, position, composition, context, and so forth. Specific ideas include the following: \n Art: Create an original work of art that represents your concern relative to a social issue. Persuade a museum, club, show, college, church, or community organization to feature your work in an upcoming exhibit or publish your work online or at a specific location. For example, one of my students created a graphic image of two hands clasping, one belonging to a Black American and one belonging to a White American. My student persuaded a local chapter of Black Lives Matter to print her image on their posters.  \nBusiness Logo or Ad: Locate a business in your neighborhood that does not display a logo on its website, storefront, clothing, or other place. Create a logo or an advertisement for that business. In your letter, persuade the owner to adopt your image. For example, one of my students created an tool company’s logo by spelling the company name with images of a hammer and a screwdriver. The owner loved it! \nCharity Logo or Ad: Create a logo, advertisement, or image in behalf of a charity in your neighborhood. Examples include an animal shelter, food pantry, community garden, homeless shelter, a learning center, and other local charity. For example, one of my students created an image of a dog chasing its tail for an upcoming adoption campaign and wrote a persuasive letter to the rescue’s owner. Another student created a poster as a Public Service Announcement (PSA) on bullying and wrote a letter to North Lake College’s student government.\n Non-profit Ad or Poster: Create a logo, advertisement, poster, or banner for your church or club. For example, one of my Catholic students created a logo of a dove with wings for his local congregation, and one of my Baptist students created a poster for an upcoming blood-drive. Both students wrote persuasive letters to their clergy.\n Topic Warning \nMany companies and organizations have corrected or resolved cases involving harmful propaganda.

This can be found by looking at the existing literature on the topic/problem and see what is missing or what has been identified as needing further study. At the end of every dissertation, and many research-based articles there is a section dedicated to what is needed to further study the topic/problem. These are excellent resources to check and read through for ideas on topics and problems for research studies.\n(2) Practices, Policies or Procedures That Led to the Problem-In this section, explain what has brought this problem to light causing it to need to be studied. What has happened that has created this problem? Think of this as the “why this is so important to educational research” section of the paper.\n(3) Importance of the Problem -In this section, discuss how this problem is significant to teaching and learning. Explain previous ways the problem has been addressed in the past. If there is little to no research on the problem (and it is highly unlikely that there will be no literature at all relating to the problem) then explain this in this section. Talk about the missing parts of the research that lead you to explore this problem.\n(4) Steps Taken to Address Problem-In this section, explain what steps, if any, have already been taken to address the problem. Share your own ideas on possible solutions for the problem.  You may use first person in this section only.\n(5) Biblical Worldview-In this section, offer a biblical worldview perspective on the problem. Explain why the resolution of the problem is important as it relates to scripture and your Biblical worldview.\nFormat the paper according to current APA format and see the grading rubric for specific grading criteria.",":slug7":"can-you-answer-this-question-assignment-help",":category7":"Reading homework help",":tag7":"Assignment help",":title8":"Final part to Ford research paper- tips from professor (9 pages) - f",":excerpt8":"Final Scholarly Paper: Tying it all together!\nFirst, combine Parts I-III of your paper.

This assignment will help you consider the influence of your cultural memberships on your ability to work professionally with people of similar cultural backgrounds, as well as with people from different cultural backgrounds. All clinicians have biases. Failure to recognize these biases creates harm. It takes more strength to acknowledge your biases than to argue that you have none.\nDr. Pamela Hays developed the ADDRESSING model to help psychologists recognize 10 major factors of cultural difference that are common in the United States: Age (and generational influences), Developmental and acquired Disabilities, Religion and spiritual identity, Ethnicity and racial identity, Socioeconomic status, Sexual orientation, Indigenous heritage, National origin, and Gender. Note that this list is not comprehensive; there are thousands of different cultural identities in our country. The ADDRESSING model just sums up the 10 most common points of cultural difference.\nInstructions\n\nUse the Hays ADDRESSING Model Template linked in Resources to conduct a cultural self-assessment that describes your identity in all elements of the Hays ADDRESSING model.\n        \nYou must complete and submit the Hays ADDRESSING Model Template provided for this assignment.

Unfortunately, the word is often conflated with other terms and misused. Most often, the terms culture, race, and ethnicity are used interchangeably although they are actually three distinct concepts that have some overlap. In this unit, you will learn about the differences among race, ethnicity, and culture.\nIn this section, you will be reviewing various isms, including sexism, heterosexism, anti-Semitism, and racism. However, before delving into those specific concepts, you will review the overarching \"social phenomena that fuel them\" (Carter, 2015, p. 28). Your text indicates that bias, prejudice, discrimination, and stereotypes maintain the presence of isms in our social environment. In this discussion, you will discuss stereotypes and how they affect people. You will also create a research proposal aimed at studying stereotypes.\nInstructions\nIdentify two stereotypes, each related to a different cultural group within Hays's ADDRESSING Model. For example, you may identify a gender-based stereotype and a stereotype based on a different culture.\n\nCompare and contrast the stereotypes and their effects on the subjects of the stereotypes.\n\nNext, describe a design for a research study related to your specialization that investigates stereotypes. You may investigate anything related to stereotypes, such as the emotional impact of stereotyping on Asian Americans.\n Carter, L. D. (2015). Reflecting humanity: Biological, psychological, and sociological perspectives (2nd ed.). Dubuque, IA: Kendall Hunt. \n\nExplain, briefly, what your research study plans to investigate and why it is important.\n    \nWhat ethical standards apply to your research?\nHow will you recruit participants?\nWhat types of research biases will you want to avoid in your study?\n\n\n At least at least 350 words. \n\n\n\n2.\n \nResearching Stereotypes\nStereotypes, like bias, are a social phenomenon that fuels isms. Every culture has stereotypes.\nPart of understanding stereotypes more deeply requires us to answer such questions as \"How are stereotypes formed?\" \"What attitudes, beliefs, or experiences maintain stereotypes?\" and \"How are stereotypes changed?\" That is where research comes in. Unfortunately, it is hard to research a topic when research participants do not want to admit that they hold stereotypes, let alone use them to make life decisions.\nFor this section, you will address religious stereotypes and create a research study that investigates those stereotypes within a religious culture of your choice. Finally, you will evaluate how cultural and research biases will affect your study.\nInstructions\nYour response will have two parts. First, complete the following:\n\nIdentify two stereotypes about a specific religion or faith.\nCompare and contrast the stereotypes and their effects on the subjects of the stereotypes.\n\nNext, describe a design for a research study related to your specialization that investigates an issue related to a stereotype or is counter to a stereotype. You may investigate anything related to the faith or religion, and stereotypes. For example, if you were a chemical dependency counselor, you might investigate alcoholism in Jewish Americans.\n\nExplain, briefly, what your research study plans to investigate and why this is important.\nArticulate the cultural biases that may surface in your research and how you will manage or avoid them.\nExplain how will you recruit participants.\nDiscern the types of research biases you will want to avoid in the study.\n At least at least 350 words.",":slug17":"1-analyzing-stereotypes-and-2-researching-stereotypes-assignment-help",":category17":"Psychology homework help",":tag17":"Assignment help",":title18":"Stress and Health Question - PSY",":excerpt18":"HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY: STRESS AND COPING\nPeople react to and cope with stress in their lives in a variety of ways.

I'm excited to see what you can do with this.\nJust to make sure all of our bases are covered, I'd like to lay out where we're at with this, so that you have one easy place to look back to if you need any details. First off, this is all in service of our upcoming Northside Youth Rising initiative, which is intended to prevent youth violence and generally keep kids in school. Since this is such a huge undertaking, we'll be partnering with the a couple of other Riverbend City nonprofits, the Riverbend Services Consortium and Second Chance Riverbend; outside of the nonprofit community, the coalition will include Elm Creek Lutheran Church, St. Francis Borgia Catholic Church, Crandall Manufacturing, Franzen InterTech, and liaisons from the Riverbend City school system and the Hennsey County juvenile justice system. Needless to say, that's a lot of moving parts to manage.\nKicking this all off will be the Northside Blues Blowout fundraising concert; that's where you come in. We've never tried anything at this level of size or complexity before, and I want to make sure we're ready. I have absolute trust in your ability to project-manage the concert. However, I do worry about our ability as an organization to all pull the oars at the same time, if you catch my drift. We're not going to be able to coordinate very well with a bunch of external entities if we're not functioning as a team. To that end, I'd feel a lot better about this if you could do sort of an informal stakeholder survey, just talk to people around the hall and see if people seem like they're in the right frame of mind to do this. After you've done this, I'd love to get your read on what people are saying and what kind of situation this all adds up to.\nThanks- we're counting on you!\n— Jayme\nCLOSE \nhttp://media.capella.edu/CourseMedia/HMSV5340/InternalDynamics/wrapper.asp",":slug6":"discussion-human-resource-management-homework-help-assignment-help-113",":category6":"Human Resource Management homework help",":tag6":"Assignment help",":title7":"The toll booth - Programming",":excerpt7":"The number of vehicles which are passing through the toll booth requires the use of an automated system to keep track o",":body7":"The number of vehicles which are passing through the toll booth requires the use of an automated system to keep track of the revenues which are being observed daily.

Whereas abstracts target readers who research, executive summaries targets readers who need some or all the information in the paper in order to make a decision. Many people will also read the executive summary in order to clearly understand the organization and results of a paper prior to reading the paper itself.\nFor the Executive Summary, you must pretend you are my Graduate Assistant, and I have asked you to read Orwell's essay. You will write an Executive Summary that will indicate to me whether or not I should use the essay in a Political Science Graduate Seminar on the relationship between Politics and Language.\n\nRequirements on Format:\n1-2 pages, double-spaced, Times New Roman, 12 font only (I will deduct points if your Summary exceeds 2 pages), and 1 inch margins.\n2- Follow The Political Science Student Writer's Manual for instructions on title pages (page 65); the summary begins after the title page, and your name should only be included on title page. No heading on the actual summary. For a sample executive summary, please consult page 67.\n\nTips for writing a strong, effective Executive Summary:\nBe Brief: Since an Executive Summary is often intended for a policy maker, decision maker, or evaluator who may not have time to read the original, you must be brief but precise and detailed. Make sure to objectively include an accurate summary of the essay's intent, approach to supporting its claim and reasons, evidence, and conclusion (do not offer an opinion on the argument itself!).\n\nBe Clear: An Executive Summary should clearly describe the conclusions of the paper at the beginning (BLUF—Bottom Line Up Front) and offer (in one-two sentences) a recommendation at the end of its summary. The Executive Summary must never leave a reader confused as to the paper's conclusions, significance, or implications for the future. Keep the structure simple and the language easily digestible; your prose needs to be accessible to the needs of the reader.

A living thing grows, undergoes metabolism, responds to its environment, reproduces, passes DNA to the next generation, maintains homeostasis, changes over time, and is made up of cells. A non-living thing may seem to do one or more of these things, but to be classified as living; all eight characteristics must be present. Sometimes, you may see something that seems alive but is not. Though you can’t see it, you have likely experienced it; one of those things is a virus.\n\nAnswer BOTH of the following questions:\n\nUsing all 8 of the characteristics that define life, indicate which one(s) viruses have and which one(s) they do not, and explain each difference. \nWith these results, present an argument that a virus is a living thing. Then, present the opposite argument that viruses are not alive. \n\nYou can fill out a table like this (though this is not required):\n\nCharacteristic\nVirus\n(yes, no, maybe, sort of)\nExplanation\nReproduce\nPass along their traits through DNA\nConsume energy sources and expel waste products to maintain homeostasis\nRespond to their environments\nRespond to stimulus\nChange over time\nCan differ as individuals while still being part of a species\nAre made up of cells\nReview the following videos to understand what viruses are and how they work:\n\nFlu Attack! How a Virus Invades Your Body\nWhat is a Virus? How do Viruses Work?\n\nReading these discussions may help you to form your arguments on the status of viruses:\n\nAre Viruses Alive?\nAre Viruses Alive? Although Viruses Challenge Our Concept of What \"Living\" Means, They Are Vital Members of the Web of Life\n\nFollow these guidelines for your paper:\n\nUtilize at least 1 credible source to support the arguments presented in the paper. Make sure you cite appropriately within your paper, and list the reference(s) in APA format on your Reference page.\nYour paper should be 1–2 pages in length, not counting the Title page and Reference page.\n\nReferences\nNPR.

I expect you all to have healthy debate around these issues. \nYou may need to review laws in the state where you hope to practice as the \"age of consent\" may vary by state based on the chronological age of the child and/or the reason why they are seeking treatment. \n1. Susie (16-years-old) and Susie’s parents came in to discuss treatment with LMFT Mark. LMFT Mark reviewed his standard informed consent with both Susie and her parents, including a section on confidentiality which briefly mentioned reasons for a breach of confidentiality including “harm to self.” After the third session, Susie admitted to LMFT Mark that she was sexually active with a few different people in her high school, and that she smoked marijuana on weekends. LMFT Mark determined that this did not rise to the level of “harm to self” worthy of a breach of confidentiality but instead he would work with her clinically. After the fifth session, she told LMFT Mark that she had been “cutting” but never near an artery. LMFT Mark again determined not to breach confidentiality. After the seventh session, Susie told LMFT Mark that she had been drinking heavily, and had started blacking out at parties, waking up in strange beds (clearly having had sexual intercourse). LMFT Mark decided to tell Susie’s parents about the drinking and blackouts.\n2.  LMFT Mable has been seeing Davey (5-years-old) for almost a year. Throughout the treatment, Davey has talked about his relationship with his parents and how their divorce makes him sad. Davey has indicated that while he loves his Mom, he likes spending time with his Dad more because his Dad doesn’t yell at him as much and Mom seems to always “be out.” Recently, Mom has called LMFT Mable and asked for a copy of Davey’s file so she can “use it in the custody battle.” LMFT Mable is not sure whether she is legally mandated to turn over the file to Mom. Also, she recently received a subpoena from Dad’s attorney for Davey’s file. LMFT Mable is not sure if she can legally or clinically should turn over the files.\nA.

For many, it boils down to a basic debate over priorities: the constitutional right to bear arms and protect oneself vs. an effort to reduce violence. The U.S. has the highest gun ownership rate in the world and the highest gun violence rate of any Western nation. It also has some of the loosest gun control laws.  Attempts to enact moderate new gun control measures have been voted down in the Senate, due in part to the powerful political influence of gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association.\nWatch the below video.\nWatch VideoThe school where teachers are armedDuration: 3:41\nUser: n/a - Added: 12/2/14YouTube URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyVZUHyp3OE\nThe school where teachers are armed.

Your narrative should focus on a specific event in a narrow timeframe, using vivid description, narration, detail, and dialogue to organize your memories and make the significance of what happened clear to an audience.\n Assignment\nA narrative is a specific type of essay that uses stories of particular moments to help audiences perceive, understand, and \"appreciate the value of an idea\" (The Composition of Everyday Life, Ch. 1, p. 19).\nFor this essay, you will write a learning narrative, a specific type of narrative that focuses on showing how a particular moment from your memory changed how you thought about yourself or others. The learning narrative requires you to organize your memories and decide which details best show an audience how the events from your past affected you. A learning narrative is broader than a \"literacy narrative\": while you can write about how language or education changed your life, you also can write about other things you learned through music, sports, business, or in any other relevant setting. \nIn order to write a strong, focused narrative, you will need to be attentive to the following expectations for the essay:\n\nFind the significance: Think of how your narrative connects your memories to feelings / concepts others have experienced\nTell a particular story: Like Keller and Zimmer, choose a single moment or event that can reflect your process of learning\nChoose relevant details: Include only those details that contribute to the significance\nNarrate and describe: Add emotional weight and interest to your story by narrating events with dialogue, action, description, and sensory experiences\n\nCaution: Please keep in mind that writing in this class is public, and anything you write about yourself may be shared with other students and instructors. Please only write about details that you are comfortable making public within our classroom community.

What are significant experiences in my life?\nHow is my own perspective on experiences different than the experiences of others? How do I perceive and report my experiences differently?\nWhat significance do I perceive in my memories and experiences now that I missed earlier in my life?\nHow does writing about my experiences help me gain a more focused critical perspective on myself and on my understanding of the communities around me?\nHow can I use my experiences to build trust and credibility (ethos) as a writer? How can I establish emotional connections with an audience?\nWhat issues and audiences from my personal experiences and memories are most important to me?

You should download the provided outline and use that to structure your paper, and consult the assignment guidance and modeled example for additional help. Finally, before submitting your assignment please use the checklist to ensure that you have completed all of the requirements.\nOverview\nThis course has three written assignments that build upon one another  and are designed to take you step-by-step through a process of writing a  paper that identifies an ethical question, examines the context,  issues, and arguments surrounding the question, and attempts to defend  an answer to that question using strong moral reasoning.\nIn the Week 1 assignment, “Ethical Question,” you chose an ethical  question, provided an introduction, a position statement and supporting  reason, and an opposing position statement and supporting reason.\nIn the Week 3 assignment, “Applying an Ethical Theory,” you explained  utilitarianism, deontology, or virtue ethics, including its core moral  principle or ideal, and applied that theory to the topic by  demonstrating how its principles would support a particular position on  your ethical question.\nIn this final written assignment, you will combine what you have done  in these two exercises by examining an ethical issue and defending your  own position on an ethical question regarding that issue.\nThis final written assignment should be written in essay form with the following clearly labeled sections:\n\nIntroduction\nEthical Argument\nExplanation and Defense\nObjection and Response\nConclusion\n\nThe paper should be between 1,300 and 1,500 words, utilize three  scholarly resources, and include a title page and reference page.\nPart 1: Introduction\nIn this section of the paper, you will begin with your ethical  question, introduce the topic and paper, and close with a thesis  statement.\n\nThe ethical question may be the same as your Week 3 written  assignment (“Applying an Ethical Theory”) or a revised version of it.\nThe introduction should be revised in a way that reflects your additional thinking on the issue and question.\nEnd this section with a thesis statement that states your position  on the issue (the answer to the ethical question you believe is  strongest) and provides a brief summary of the main ideas you will be  presenting in the paper. Please see the assignment guidance for examples  of thesis statements.\n\nPlace the introduction under the Part 1: Introduction heading.\nPart 2: Ethical Argument\nIn this section of the paper, you will present the strongest argument  you can in support of the position you have stated in your  introduction.\n\nThis will be similar to the “supporting reasons” you offered in the  first assignment; however, this argument should reflect your research  into the key ethical issues that need to be identified and addressed,  the arguments on different sides of this problem, and the theories of  moral reasoning we have studied in the class (you will discuss the  specific details and implications of the moral theories in the next two  sections).\nYou can think of this as a summary of the main argument you would  give if you were an attorney trying to convince a jury of your position.\n\nPlace this information under the Part 2: Ethical Argument heading.\nPart 3: Explanation and Defense\nIn this section, you will explain and defend your argument by drawing  on the moral theory that aligns most closely with the argument you  presented in Part 2. This may be the same theory you discussed in your  second assignment, but it may also be a different theory.\n\nYou must first explain the theory in general terms similar to how  you explained a theory in your second assignment, including a brief  account of the historical background of the theory and the  philosopher(s) associated with it and general overview of the core moral  ideal or principle of the theory, including the way it guides and  constrains moral reasoning.\nYou should then clearly show how your argument represents an application of that form of moral reasoning.\nIn other words, if the argument you present in Part 2 is  utilitarian, deontological, or virtue-based (teleological), you will  want to explain utilitarianism, deontology, or virtue ethics in general  terms, then explain how your argument from Part 2 reflects or draws upon  the core principles and values of that theory. Please refer to the Week  3 assignment instructions for directions on how to explain and apply  the moral theory.\n\nPlace this section under the Part 3: Explanation and Defense heading.\nPart 4: Objection and Response\nIn this section of the paper, you will present the strongest  objection you can to your argument, and briefly defend that objection by  appealing to a different ethical theory than the one you focused on in  Part 3.\n\nBriefly explain the core moral ideal or principle of the theory and  how that could be the basis of an objection to your argument. For  instance, if you explained and defended your own argument by applying  the principles of virtue ethics, you could raise an objection from the  perspective of utilitarianism by briefly explaining the core utilitarian  principle and how applying that principle could lead someone to a  different conclusion than the one you are defending.\nNext, you should respond to the objection by explaining why it is  not strong enough to undermine the main argument in defense of your  position.\nSee the assignment guidance for suggestions on how to effectively respond to the objection.\n\nPlace this section under the Part 4: Objection and Response heading.\nPart 5: Conclusion\nIn this section of the paper, provide a summary of what you have done  in the paper by briefly describing what you accomplished in each of the  above sections.\nPlace this section under the Part 5: Conclusion heading.\nResource Requirement\nYou must use at least three scholarly resources, only one of which  may be the textbook. In other words, you must use at least two scholarly  resources in addition to the textbook.\nAcceptable ways of using a source include providing a quotation,  summary, or paraphrase; merely providing a citation, especially when it  is unclear how or where the text supports your claim, is not sufficient.\nIf you need help with finding additional resources or are unsure  about whether a particular resource will count toward the requirement,  please contact your instructor.\nFor sources to count toward the resources requirement, they must be  cited within the text of your paper and on the reference page. Sources  that are listed on the references page but not cited within the paper do  not count toward fulfilling the resources requirement.\nIn your paper,\n\nIntroduce the topic and paper.\nProvide a thesis statement.\nPresent an argument in support of the position.\nDefend the argument by explaining and applying the ethical theory that most closely aligns with the argument.\nPresent an objection to the argument by appealing to a different ethical theory.\nRespond to the objection.\nProvide a conclusion that describes what was accomplished in each of the sections of the paper.\n\nThe Ethical Reasoning Final Paper\n\nMust be 1,300 to 1,500 words in length (not including title and  references pages) and formatted according to APA style as outlined in  the Ashford Writing Center’s APA Style  (Links to an external site.)resource.\nMust include a separate title page with the following: \n    \nTitle of paper\nStudent’s name\nCourse name and number\nInstructor’s name\nDate submitted\n\n\n\nFor further assistance with the formatting and the title page, refer to APA Formatting for Word 2013 (Links to an external site.).\n\nMust utilize academic voice.

Such improvements include less use of antipsychotic drugs, a reduction in chemical and physical restraint use, and a reduction in inappropriate use of indwelling urinary catheters.\nMandates\nThe quality of care mandates contained within OBRA, and the regulations, require that a nursing home must provide services and activities to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident in accordance with a written plan of care. \nIn order to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs, nursing homes must be in compliance with the federal requirements for nursing homes.\nThe mandates of OBRA are regarded in the nursing home setting to represent minimum accepted standards of care. The failure of a nursing home to comply with the OBRA quality of care mandates in caring for a resident represents a failure to exercise the degree of reasonable care and skill that should be expected.\nPenalties\nThe Indiana State Department of Health is responsible for ensuring that nursing homes follow these mandates through the state survey process. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the states may apply penalties against nursing homes for failure to meet the minimum standard of care as defined in the OBRA regulations. \nSuch penalties may include fines, appointment of administrative consultants to run the nursing home while deficiencies are remedied, and even closure of a nursing home.\n\nResidents must be assessed to identify their medical problems and their abilities to perform basic self-care activities. The DHHS established a uniform data set, referred to as the minimum data set (MDS), to document this assessment.\nThe nursing home is responsible for the safety of each resident. This includes being responsible for orders written by the resident’s primary physician or other medical provider.

(1 page)\n                                               Classmate’s Post\nI can know that God is because the creation reveals the existence of the Creator. The majesty of our world leads me to acknowledge His power and might. The intricate design teaches me that God is intelligent, far more than I. The orderliness indicates that God planned an intentional creation with no accidents or mutations. The world teaches me several things about God, but what it cannot teach me is what to do about God. That is why God revealed Himself to us in the book we call the Bible, and it is why we must educate ourselves about Him.\nGod’s revelation about Himself began in Eden. His bringing Adam the animals to name was not an exercise in zoology, but a wonderfully creative teaching moment. It was so Adam would understand that animals were not sufficient; he needed a woman for companionship (Gen. 2). When Adam and Eve hid from God, He asked them where they were. He knew the answer, but He was guiding them to the understanding that they had left His side (Gen. 3). These two examples show us that from the beginning of creation, God was teaching man. He intended for man both to know Him and to be in the right relationship with Him.\nChristian education has a different goal, then, than other types of education. It is not about passing a class, making a grade, or developing manual skills. Our purpose is to teach others to know God (Jud. 2:10) in both mind and heart. The emotional response to learning about God is valid and vital, but Paul offered a stark warning about the emotional without the factual (Rom. 10:1-3). God is against heart without head; He is equally against head without heart (Jam. 2:19; Matt. 15:8).\nHow do we ensure we have head and heart? We begin with the facts from the Bible. Faith in God is not faith in God if we do not accept the facts the way God gave them to us; it is only faith in what we can prove extra-biblically. We must believe that God created the world in 6 literal 24-hour days as recorded in Genesis 1 and 2. If we do not, we have no basis for believing anything else the Bible says. We must believe that every geographic and historic detail is accurate even if secular academia lacks proof. When we learn Bible facts, we are learning what God is teaching. We understand how right God is and has always been, and we begin to think right about God.\nBut Biblical education is not a “just the facts, ma’am” endeavor. Powers (1996, p. 22) used the phrase “tutored emotions” to describe where this education should lead. Our journey into the text should provide more than facts to assimilate; it should provide us with a connection not only to Bible characters, but also to God. When we follow Abram’s story from Ur to Egypt, we learn what it means for man to trust God for He is worthy of that trust. When we observe the body-wracking sobs of Peter the Denier as the Christ turns and looks upon him (Luke 22:60-61), we remember our own failures and cry with him, knowing that Christ is looking at us, too. When we travel in our minds’ eye to the cross, we are moved by the love of Mary and devotion of John. These are proper emotions, tutored emotions, because they are based on the foundation of facts. When we experience this kind of education, we feel right about God.\nEffective Bible education is not finished yet. Our thinking right and feeling right about God must lead us to do right about God. Abraham’s faith challenges us to step out in faith as we serve God, even though we may not know where we are going! Peter’s repentance galvanizes us not to stop with sorrow but to correct our behavior and seek forgiveness. Mary and John inspire us to stand at the foot of Jesus’ cross no matter how big the evil crowd is. This education directs us in living an obedient faith, a faith that does right about God.\nWhen our teaching guides our students to think, feel, and do right about God, we will have fulfilled our mission to teach them to know God. Our work is not done, though. Now, we can train them to teach others, too!",":slug6":"need-in-10-hours-or-less-applied-sciences-homework-help-assignment-help-3",":category6":"Applied Sciences homework help",":tag6":"Assignment help",":title7":"Assignment 1: Reading homework help - public 10",":excerpt7":"This assignment will be submitted to Turnitin®. \nDirections: For this assignment you are to do the following:\n\nPick a ",":body7":"This assignment will be submitted to Turnitin®. \nDirections: For this assignment you are to do the following:\n\nPick a topic in the realm of public safety.  You will want this topic to be something that has two variables, is interesting and brings a new twist to the topic.  Describe your topic in the first paragraph.\nDevelop and state your research question in the second paragraph.  This should be in the form of a specific question.  This question must be measurable and will be used to develop your unique research investigation.\nUse empirical research (information obtained from scholarly sources suffices this requirement) to help substantiate the importance of the topic.

(1 page)\n                                                   Classmate’s Post\nI remember the first lesson/talk I gave in church. I was eight years old, and I was giving a short address on the Holy Spirit. I remember standing in front of my peers and speaking into the microphone while I gripped the podium with all my energy. I made it around one minute into my talk, and then I remember everything going dark.\nAs the legend goes, I began to slur my words as I stepped back away from the podium. Teachers and my peers thought I was too shy and was stepping back to sit in my chair. Instead, I slumped over and landed flat on the ground. The room was filled with screams, the heavens fell, and my teacher panicked and ran out of the room to fetch my parents.\nAfter thirty seconds or so, the room fell silent as they watched me start to move and then give a huge smile on my face. Inside my head, I did not know that I had passed out. I remember feeling warmth wrap my entire body. I remember feeling the most overwhelming love as the warmth enveloped my whole body. Then I opened my eyes and found myself lying on the ground in front of the entire class.\nMy story has been at the forefront of my mind each time I preach or teach the gospel to investigators. In a way, my experience is an example of the learning cycle many of us go through. As I read the assigned chapters of this story, again, the story kept entering my mind. This is especially true for chapter 4 when the author wrote, \"Not once in Scripture do we find Jesus saying, \"Our lesson for today is Leviticus, scroll 3.\" His teaching flowed out of the needs of the people He taught. It flowed out of the problem situations they presented. It flowed out of the real crises of life.\"\nAs investigators approach the church, I know they are nervous and doing the best they can. However, often their desire to learn is met with unforeseen difficulties. As a teacher, I do everything I can to bring the spirit into the lessons to feel the overwhelming love from our Lord Jesus Christ. I know that if I can facilitate and guide the investigator to allow the spirit to reside. Then the Holy Spirit will do the teaching.\nThat is why I enjoyed chapter four so much. It renewed my feelings of respect and love for the way Jesus Christ taught. I especially appreciated the idea that \"Jesus taught people more than lessons.\" In my faith tradition, our missionaries traditionally memorized several lesson plans before entering the mission field. When they found an investigator, they would go to lesson 1-10, making sure they did not skip any class. Each lesson had flip charts, assigned scriptures, and scripted parts.\nEven though this approach found success, it became evident that it did not allow for personalized lessons. It also left the missionaries at a loss when they were approached with questions outside the lesson plans. In the words of chapter four, we discovered that \"the prime emphasis of disciplers is the people in the chairs, not the lines in the lesson. God's Word is Truth. But it becomes \"truth that matters to me\" for learners as it intersects learners where they live.\"\nJesus Christ taught this way because He is more interested in our character's content than the content of the mind. As the author puts it, \"The Pharisees knew their content,\" but \"[t]heir religion was a superficial, technical, external show of rote actions and memorized rules, a tedious rule book that led them to become sanctimonious faultfinders.\" However, \"Jesus was more interested in internal character than external show. Character focuses on the head: knowing what God has said and understanding what He expects.\"\nThe assigned reading has helped me reaffirm the need to focus on the learner as Jesus did. Likewise, I know the learner must be led to the Holy Spirit to be truly converted to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. He will teach, enlighten, and confirm. Then the true change will occur.\n                                              Reference:\nYount, William. The Teaching Ministry of the Church: Second Edition, B&H Publishing Group, 2008.

In this discussion, you will have the opportunity to consider some of the IMF’s actions and determine whether they were beneficial as well as ethical.\nTo help frame this discussion, consider the IMF’s actions in Greece. Greece spent a decade in economic turmoil starting in 2009. The IMF provided financial assistance to “bail out” Greece multiple times during the crisis. Their loans came with requirements that Greece needed to meet. Some argue that the IMF made the crisis much worse, whereas others feel the IMF provided timely support to Greece not long after the global financial crisis of 2008.\nIn your initial post, use the following questions to guide your responses:\n\nWhen should a government, economy, or country be bailed out, if ever? Justify your answer with specific examples and how the bailout or lack of bailout would impact the global economy and the future of globalization.\nIdeally, which countries or organizations would provide the economic support for a government that needs a bailout? Is the IMF the ideal organization to bail out a country?\nIs it ethical for the IMF to bail out countries that repeatedly make bad economic and fiscal decisions?

You will a",":body9":"For your final project, you will develop a basic departmental policy recommendation to address a public need. You will analyze historical data and relevant state\nor federal policies, apply relevant criminological theories, and evaluate the potential impact of the departmental policy on the general public.\nPublic policy can be defined as the decisions, actions, laws, and positions of both the state and federal government. A public policy issue is at the center of public\npolicy, and the state and federal government react to the issue and make decisions such as creating laws and regulations to help address the public policy issue.\nPublic policies also provide guidance and direction to public safety organizations and are the principles that guide the actions of the personnel. The term public\npolicy is not normally used to denote what is actually done. Departmental policies are the procedures or protocols that are created to address this public policy\nissue, and these departmental policies are what will be scrutinized in a highly publicized incident. Therefore, it is vital that departmental policies are developed\nand updated to be consistent with public policy, to address issues within public policy, and to best serve the interests of the department and the community. To\ndo so effectively, criminological theories are applied to address specific motives and underlying factors influencing the issue at hand. These theories assist in\ndeveloping departmental policies that can stand the test of time, not conflict with public policy, and remain flexible enough to adapt to societal changes.\nThe project is divided into three milestones, which will be submitted at various points throughout the course to scaffold learning and ensure quality final\nsubmissions. These milestones will be submitted in Modules Three, Five, and Seven. The final product will be submitted in Module Nine.\nThis assessment addresses the following course outcomes:\n Analyze criminological theories for their influence on the development of departmental and public policies\n Assess the extent to which public policies address the needs of the public and criminal justice system by applying criminological theories\n Evaluate the potential impact of policy recommendations on communities and the criminal justice system for informing appropriate policy development\nand implementation\n Analyze trends impacting the evolution of public policies for drawing informed conclusions on future policy development\n Propose policy recommendations for improving the delivery of criminal justice services\nPrompt\nFor this project, you will play the part of an individual recently promoted in a criminal justice organization. Your new supervisor recognizes that you are an upand-\ncoming asset for the department and acknowledges that your advanced degree gives you an edge over some of the other employees in a project that needs\nto be completed as soon as possible. Your supervisor tells you that after some highly publicized news events, many departmental policies have been found to be\noutdated and insufficient in unspecified areas in relation to issues within public policy. The departmental policies need to be revised to include justification for\nthe policies, as well as relevant theory to support the operations. Your supervisor has provided a list of public policy issues, and you will select one public policy\nissue as well as a related departmental policy that attempts to address the issue. You will be tasked with analyzing the public policy issue and developingrecommendations to improve the corresponding departmental policy to better address the specific issue. To develop an informed departmental policy recommendation, you will also analyze relevant criminological theories and relevant public policies.\nSpecifically, the following critical elements must be addressed:\nRoman One\nIntroduction: Describe your selected public policy issue, corresponding departmental policy, and explain the connection between the public policy issue and specific departmental policy.\nII.\nHistorical Analysis: To inform your recommendations for the departmental public policy, you will analyze the history of the selected public policy issue, identifying key influential trends, and predict the potential future direction of the state or federal policies in supporting this issue. Specifically:\na)\nIdentify key trends, both modern and historical, that have shaped the evolution of the state or federal public policies surrounding your selected public policy issue, justifying your identifications. How have the policies around this issue evolved, and what trends have influenced this evolution?\nb)\nIdentify court cases that have shaped the evolution of the public policies related to your chosen public policy issue, justifying your identifications.\nc)\nHow have the previously identified historical events impacted the public’s perception of the relevant state or federal public policies? Provide specific examples. How has public perception evolved in relation to these specified events?\nd)\nPredict the potential future direction of the state or federal public policies based on the previously identified historical and modern trends. How might the state or federal public policy continue to evolve?\nIII.\nCriminological Theory: Now that you have analyzed the related state or federal public policies, you will analyze relevant criminological theory.\na)\nSelect a criminological theory that best explains the development of the public policies related to the issue, justifying your selection. Consider how the theory explains the previously identified influence of the trends or court cases on the development of the policies.\nb)\nDraw connections between the selected criminological theory and the departmental policy. Where are there specific connections between the theory and the departmental policy?\nc)\nDraw connections between the selected criminological theory and the related state o r federal public policies. Where are there specific connections between the theory and the selected state or federal policies?\nIV.\nNeeds: Now that you have analyzed the relevant state or federal policies and selected a related criminological theory, you will focus your analysis on your selected departmental policy. In relation to the departmental policy, you will identify the needs of the public and the relevant branch of the criminal justice system, and assess the extent to which the policy currently addresses these needs. Specifically:\na)\nIdentify specific needs of the public and the relevant branch of the criminal justice system at the center of the departmental policy, justifying your identifications.\nb)\nTo what extent does the departmental policy address these specific needs?\nV.\nPolicy Recommendations: In this section, you will provide specific recommendations to the existing departmental public policy to improve the delivery of criminal justice services, justifying your recommendations, and examining the impact of the recommendations on the public and specific branch of the criminal justice system. Be sure to:\na)\nOutline the specific aspects of the departmental policy you are targeting for your recommendations, justifying your selections. What specific aspects of the departmental policy need improving and why?\nb)\nWhat specific recommendations do you have to improve the existing departmental policy?\nc)\nJustify how the recommendations will improve the delivery of criminal justice services. Provide specific examples.\nd)\nHow does criminological theory support your recommendations? How do the recommendations support the public’s needs? Consider how theory justifies the appropriateness of the recommendations for the departmental policy.\ne)\nWhat are the potential impacts of the departmental policy recommendations on the public and the relevant branch of the criminal justice system? Provide specific examples. If the potential impacts are negative, how might you alter your recommendations?\nf)\nHow does your assessment of the potential impacts inform your departmental policy implementation? For example, how can you capitalize on positive reactions in the implementation of the departmental policy? How might you create buy-in where there is possible conflict?\nMilestones\nMilestone One: Departmental Policy and Issue Selection and Introduction\nIn Module Three, you will submit a 1–2-page document introducing the public policy issue that your departmental policy will seek to address. First, review the document A List of Public Policy Issues and select an issue. Next, review the document Examples of Departmental Policies and select a departmental policy that you plan to make improvement recommendations for to address this issue. Discuss related public policies (decisions, actions, laws, and/or positions) of both the state and federal government on the issue that you seek to address with your departmental policy. Describe your selected policy issue, the related state or federal positions or actions on the issue, and explain the connection between the departmental policy and state or federal guidance on the issue. This milestone is graded with the Milestone One Rubric.\nMilestone Two: Historical Analysis and Analysis of Relevant Criminological Theories\nIn Module Five, you will submit the 2–3-page draft of your historical analysis as well as your analysis of criminological theories relevant to your public policy issue selection. You will analyze the history of the public policies (related decisions, actions, laws, and/or positions of both the state and federal government) related to your selected public policy issue. This draft should be as detailed as possible in order to allow the instructor to provide significant feedback. This milestone is graded with the Milestone Two Rubric.\nMilestone Three: Public Needs and Policy Recommendations\nIn Module Seven, you will submit the 2–3-page public needs and policy recommendations sections of your final project. This milestone is really about drilling down more deeply into the “drivers” behind your recommendations to the selected departmental policy. As you write these sections, you will identify what public needs are targeted by this policy and determine how well the policy addresses these needs. You will also need to examine how this policy can be changed or improved upon to continue to address the identified need and how these changes can be accomplished while at the same time improving upon the delivery of necessary criminal justice services. Ensure that you support your recommendations with relevant criminological theory. The draft should also incorporate the research you have performed up to this point as set forward in Milestones One and Two. This milestone is graded with the Milestone Three Rubric.\nFinal Submission: Policy Recommendation Report\nIn Module Nine, you will submit your policy recommendation report. It should be a complete, polished artifact containing all of the critical elements of the final product. It should reflect the incorporation of feedback gained throughout the course. This final submission will be graded using the Final Project Rubric.",":slug9":"week-9-final-project-due-asap",":category9":"Law homework help",":tag9":"due ASAP",":title10":"week 9 final project: Law homework help - due ASAP 2",":excerpt10":"For your final project, you will develop a basic departmental policy recommendation to address a public need. You will a",":body10":"For your final project, you will develop a basic departmental policy recommendation to address a public need. You will analyze historical data and relevant state\nor federal policies, apply relevant criminological theories, and evaluate the potential impact of the departmental policy on the general public.\nPublic policy can be defined as the decisions, actions, laws, and positions of both the state and federal government. A public policy issue is at the center of public\npolicy, and the state and federal government react to the issue and make decisions such as creating laws and regulations to help address the public policy issue.\nPublic policies also provide guidance and direction to public safety organizations and are the principles that guide the actions of the personnel. The term public\npolicy is not normally used to denote what is actually done. Departmental policies are the procedures or protocols that are created to address this public policy\nissue, and these departmental policies are what will be scrutinized in a highly publicized incident. Therefore, it is vital that departmental policies are developed\nand updated to be consistent with public policy, to address issues within public policy, and to best serve the interests of the department and the community. To\ndo so effectively, criminological theories are applied to address specific motives and underlying factors influencing the issue at hand. These theories assist in\ndeveloping departmental policies that can stand the test of time, not conflict with public policy, and remain flexible enough to adapt to societal changes.\nThe project is divided into three milestones, which will be submitted at various points throughout the course to scaffold learning and ensure quality final\nsubmissions. These milestones will be submitted in Modules Three, Five, and Seven. The final product will be submitted in Module Nine.\nThis assessment addresses the following course outcomes:\n Analyze criminological theories for their influence on the development of departmental and public policies\n Assess the extent to which public policies address the needs of the public and criminal justice system by applying criminological theories\n Evaluate the potential impact of policy recommendations on communities and the criminal justice system for informing appropriate policy development\nand implementation\n Analyze trends impacting the evolution of public policies for drawing informed conclusions on future policy development\n Propose policy recommendations for improving the delivery of criminal justice services\nPrompt\nFor this project, you will play the part of an individual recently promoted in a criminal justice organization. Your new supervisor recognizes that you are an upand-\ncoming asset for the department and acknowledges that your advanced degree gives you an edge over some of the other employees in a project that needs\nto be completed as soon as possible. Your supervisor tells you that after some highly publicized news events, many departmental policies have been found to be\noutdated and insufficient in unspecified areas in relation to issues within public policy. The departmental policies need to be revised to include justification for\nthe policies, as well as relevant theory to support the operations. Your supervisor has provided a list of public policy issues, and you will select one public policy\nissue as well as a related departmental policy that attempts to address the issue. You will be tasked with analyzing the public policy issue and developingrecommendations to improve the corresponding departmental policy to better address the specific issue. To develop an informed departmental policy recommendation, you will also analyze relevant criminological theories and relevant public policies.\nSpecifically, the following critical elements must be addressed:\nRoman One\nIntroduction: Describe your selected public policy issue, corresponding departmental policy, and explain the connection between the public policy issue and specific departmental policy.\nII.\nHistorical Analysis: To inform your recommendations for the departmental public policy, you will analyze the history of the selected public policy issue, identifying key influential trends, and predict the potential future direction of the state or federal policies in supporting this issue. Specifically:\na)\nIdentify key trends, both modern and historical, that have shaped the evolution of the state or federal public policies surrounding your selected public policy issue, justifying your identifications. How have the policies around this issue evolved, and what trends have influenced this evolution?\nb)\nIdentify court cases that have shaped the evolution of the public policies related to your chosen public policy issue, justifying your identifications.\nc)\nHow have the previously identified historical events impacted the public’s perception of the relevant state or federal public policies? Provide specific examples. How has public perception evolved in relation to these specified events?\nd)\nPredict the potential future direction of the state or federal public policies based on the previously identified historical and modern trends. How might the state or federal public policy continue to evolve?\nIII.\nCriminological Theory: Now that you have analyzed the related state or federal public policies, you will analyze relevant criminological theory.\na)\nSelect a criminological theory that best explains the development of the public policies related to the issue, justifying your selection. Consider how the theory explains the previously identified influence of the trends or court cases on the development of the policies.\nb)\nDraw connections between the selected criminological theory and the departmental policy. Where are there specific connections between the theory and the departmental policy?\nc)\nDraw connections between the selected criminological theory and the related state o r federal public policies. Where are there specific connections between the theory and the selected state or federal policies?\nIV.\nNeeds: Now that you have analyzed the relevant state or federal policies and selected a related criminological theory, you will focus your analysis on your selected departmental policy. In relation to the departmental policy, you will identify the needs of the public and the relevant branch of the criminal justice system, and assess the extent to which the policy currently addresses these needs. Specifically:\na)\nIdentify specific needs of the public and the relevant branch of the criminal justice system at the center of the departmental policy, justifying your identifications.\nb)\nTo what extent does the departmental policy address these specific needs?\nV.\nPolicy Recommendations: In this section, you will provide specific recommendations to the existing departmental public policy to improve the delivery of criminal justice services, justifying your recommendations, and examining the impact of the recommendations on the public and specific branch of the criminal justice system. Be sure to:\na)\nOutline the specific aspects of the departmental policy you are targeting for your recommendations, justifying your selections. What specific aspects of the departmental policy need improving and why?\nb)\nWhat specific recommendations do you have to improve the existing departmental policy?\nc)\nJustify how the recommendations will improve the delivery of criminal justice services. Provide specific examples.\nd)\nHow does criminological theory support your recommendations? How do the recommendations support the public’s needs? Consider how theory justifies the appropriateness of the recommendations for the departmental policy.\ne)\nWhat are the potential impacts of the departmental policy recommendations on the public and the relevant branch of the criminal justice system? Provide specific examples. If the potential impacts are negative, how might you alter your recommendations?\nf)\nHow does your assessment of the potential impacts inform your departmental policy implementation? For example, how can you capitalize on positive reactions in the implementation of the departmental policy? How might you create buy-in where there is possible conflict?\nMilestones\nMilestone One: Departmental Policy and Issue Selection and Introduction\nIn Module Three, you will submit a 1–2-page document introducing the public policy issue that your departmental policy will seek to address. First, review the document A List of Public Policy Issues and select an issue. Next, review the document Examples of Departmental Policies and select a departmental policy that you plan to make improvement recommendations for to address this issue. Discuss related public policies (decisions, actions, laws, and/or positions) of both the state and federal government on the issue that you seek to address with your departmental policy. Describe your selected policy issue, the related state or federal positions or actions on the issue, and explain the connection between the departmental policy and state or federal guidance on the issue. This milestone is graded with the Milestone One Rubric.\nMilestone Two: Historical Analysis and Analysis of Relevant Criminological Theories\nIn Module Five, you will submit the 2–3-page draft of your historical analysis as well as your analysis of criminological theories relevant to your public policy issue selection. You will analyze the history of the public policies (related decisions, actions, laws, and/or positions of both the state and federal government) related to your selected public policy issue. This draft should be as detailed as possible in order to allow the instructor to provide significant feedback. This milestone is graded with the Milestone Two Rubric.\nMilestone Three: Public Needs and Policy Recommendations\nIn Module Seven, you will submit the 2–3-page public needs and policy recommendations sections of your final project. This milestone is really about drilling down more deeply into the “drivers” behind your recommendations to the selected departmental policy.

The pricing guidelines in a monopoly market are relatively straightforward. Since the company is the only producer offering the product, it can mark-up the price as far as the customer can bear. The pricing strategies for a producer operating in a perfect competition structure are also fairly intuitive. They are price takers, and hence price is set at the marginal cost of the product. This is due to the fact that there are many firms offering nearly identical products. However, there is optimal pricing for the market structures offering differentiated products with many competitors (oligopoly) or a few producers (monopolistic competition). These are much more complex and involved. It has been stated that differentiation in products that creates differences in customer valuation is the most prevalent type of competition. In such markets pricing strategies may include the three C's of cost, competition, and customer.\nDevelop a paper detailing an analysis of market structures and relating pricing strategies that are suitable for each of these structures.

However, the organization has run into lawful issues. A few locations accessible to lease don't adhere to state lodging laws and regulations. In certain states, a proprietor should likewise live on the property to lawfully lease lofts for brief timeframes. Moreover, these locations are needed to pay lodging or vacationer charges when leasing their homes during the special seasons. Airbnb has confronted fines and court procedures. Among political influences influencing Airbnb's model, one should incorporate the risk of illegal intimidation, because of the way that Prague is a capital city with more than 1,000,000 occupants, and with a huge number of guests, there is the conceivable danger of psychological warfare, particularly from ISIS. Accordingly, individuals might be dissuaded from traveling, particularly to significant urban areas (Sedlacek, 2016).\nAirbnb is vigorously influenced by the developing ubiquity of social media, which is essential to the sharing stage. The following most huge factor is the level of trust among clients. They are influenced by an expanding measure of single voyagers, which may impact the interest in room sharing. The stage is influenced by the number of individuals ready to burn through cash on \"elective encounters,\" and by people who are wanting to travel. Furthermore, a receptiveness to encounter distinctive culture has a place among a portion of the more huge social variables. The organization is influenced by a maturing population, since the older are not as open to new encounters, and lean toward movement bundles and great inns. The stage is influenced by society's pattern toward a better lifestyle and a higher accentuation on wellbeing. Web availability, advancement, and an expansion in the utilization of technology have offered to ascend to stages, for example, Airbnb; thus, technology is exceptionally essential to the organization's tasks. Information technologies are as yet improving, and to stay serious, Airbnb needs to utilize every single accessible source. The quantity of individuals who use mobiles and portable applications is significantly rising, and this vigorously influences the Airbnb stage. Expanding measures of individuals anticipate availability through virtual networks.\n\nPost 2\n Porter’s five forces model is used to analyze the firm’s competitive advantage. Porter’s model is the widely used approach to understand the external opportunities and threats. The model represents five individual forces which include threat of new entrants, bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of suppliers, threat of substitute products or services and rivalry among existing firms (Lehr, 2015). There are number of barriers to potential new entrants into lodging industry. Time of entry, capital investment and existing legal regulations can serve as a significant barrier. Being able to raise capital is the major success for the company. Airbnb became leading company in just few years. It came into the market at right time when the competition is less. Airbnb raised 119.20 million in two years. That does not make them free from competition. It still faces legal restriction in international business due to the county laws that restrict them from hosting the paid guests. Permits are required that involve registration and the property license will be necessary. Airbnb has grown with the industry and equipped itself to deal with such issues.\nRivalry among existing firms is ignited due to the factors that include rate of growth, diversity of competitors and role of brand equity. The global growth rate of Airbnb is 153% (Nurlansa, 2016). While Airbnb is enjoying its success, the threat coming from diversity of its competitors is causing a limitation in the growth. Flip key, Turnkey and HomeAway are giving a tough fight. Still, Airbnb is a leading global lodging company because of its high brand value. Third factor, threat of substitutes is an existing concern for Airbnb. This threat comes from the client’s dynamic requirements. Hotels and B&B can become a threat in the future.\nThe fourth factor, bargaining power of buyers is limited due to no direct substitution. This gives an advantage to Airbnb to decide the prices based on demand. Number of Airbnb’s today are less compared to number of travelers. Renter’s have less to no inclination to go for a substitute because of the amenities provided are more advantageous to them compared to hotels.\nBargaining power of Airbnb is limited as it is the middle player between host and client. It gives the hosts liberty to decide the prices while placing certain brand rules to obey. While this can act as a threat to the business, it provides an opportunity to attract more suppliers into the platform thereby expanding business. Airbnb must prepare mindful and practical rules and principle that allow them to keep their brand value while reaching larger business areas and providing service for all types of customers. \nPorter’s five forces model is used to analyze the firm’s competitive advantage.

The autocratic style is directive, assertive, aggressive, and controlling in relationships. Leaders with an autocratic style use strict policies and procedures to control the work environment. Followers have little power and are unable to challenge authority. The leader with a democratic style is open-minded, interactive, egalitarian, and collaborative, and focuses on policies and procedures less than the autocratic leader. Followers are a part of the decision-making process at all levels. The leader with a laissez-faire style uses a hands-off approach, giving followers a significant amount of autonomy to complete tasks, determine goals, and make decisions. This type of leader focuses on policies and procedures less than the democratic leader. It should be mentioned that the laissez-faire style can be “risky” and can create chaos for followers due to a lack of supervision.\nFor the Case Assignment, conduct some research then write a 3-page paper in APA format, comparing and contrasting the three classical leadership styles and the pros and cons of each style.\nCite all sources within the text and in a reference list at the end of the paper.\nLength: 3 pages double-spaced and typed .Reference page is not included in the 3 pages.",":slug1":"leadership-paper-assignment-help",":category1":"Education homework help",":tag1":"Assignment help",":title2":"Discussion Question: Nursing homework help - APA 19",":excerpt2":"What was the last communicable diseases effecting your community and what were the primary, secondary and tertiary preve",":body2":"What was the last communicable diseases effecting your community and what were the primary, secondary and tertiary prevention that the community health nurses have undertaken to prevent the spread of the disease?\n·         Must address all of the topics.\n·         100-word minimum/200-word maximum without the references.\n·         Minimum of two references in APA format, articles chosen must have been published within last 3-5 years.",":slug2":"discussion-question-nursing-homework-help-apa-19",":category2":"Nursing homework help",":tag2":"APA",":title3":"discussion post 1page length - Public Administration",":excerpt3":"Assignment\nStep #1:  Respond to the following Discussion Prompt\nDiscussion Prompt\nKayla, a supervisor, recently hired a",":body3":"Assignment\nStep #1:  Respond to the following Discussion Prompt\nDiscussion Prompt\nKayla, a supervisor, recently hired a new manager, Alex, but has received complaints from customers that they cannot understand him when they speak to him on the telephone.

The plasma membrane, for example, is an important structure of all cells and it is responsible for regulating the passage of materials into and out of the cell. Plasma membranes are differentially (selectively) permeable, meaning some substances are allowed to enter and exit the cell, while the movement of other materials is either carefully regulated or blocked. Two ways in which materials can move freely across the cell membrane are diffusion and osmosis.\nDiffusion is the movement of solutes (material dissolved in liquid) from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. If these areas are separated by a membrane, that membrane may or may not be permeable to the solute. The membrane is always permeable to water though and the movement of water across a membrane is a special form of diffusion called osmosis.\nWe will be using dialysis tubing to simulate a semipermeable membrane. This tubing allows small molecules (e.g., water, ions, glucose) to pass while preventing large molecules (e.g., macromolecules like proteins, starch, glycogen) from moving across.  Be sure you have read over the suggested material before starting this exercise and that you have reviewed the following video:\nDiffusion and Osmosis (Links to an external site.)\nWhen you are ready to begin, open the Unit 3 Experiment Answer Sheet and answer the questions associated with the first exercise.\nOsmosis - Introduction\nIn our second exercise this unit, we will to take a closer look at osmosis; the movement of water across a membrane. The direction water moves depends on the relative concentration of solute molecules on either side of the membrane (in this case, these solutes are not able to cross the membrane). Furthermore, the presence or absence of cell walls (e.g., in plant cells) influences how cells respond to osmotic fluctuations in their environment. This exercise will examine the forces that determine whether water moves into or out of a cell.\nWe will be using the following website in this exercise. Be sure you are able to access and use this website before starting.\nThe Biology Place. No Date.

It's important to note that business metrics should be employed to address key audiences surrounding a business, such as investors, customers, and different types of employees, such as executives and middle managers. Every area of business has specific performance metrics that should be monitored – marketers track marketing and social media metrics, such as campaign and program statistics, sales teams monitor sales performance metrics such as new opportunities and leads, and executives look at big picture financial metrics.\n\n \nBusiness Metric or Key Performance Indicator? What's the Difference?\nTo be effective, business metrics should be compared to established benchmarks or business objectives. This provides valuable context for the values used in the metric and allows business users to better act on the information they are viewing. For instance, $20M sales in Q4 sounds like an impressive figure; however, if you're Boeing Aircraft, this figure would have you contemplating filing for bankruptcy.\nContext allows business metrics to make an impact. In fact, this is where the line between key performance indicators and performance metrics becomes blurry.

As you explore  and analyze the prose below, make notes about the literary elements you  notice and begin to consider how the author develops his theme. \nThe following is an excerpt from Fyodor Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment. Dostoevsky uses his story to explain how when a someone commits a crime, a guilty conscience and un-confessed sin causes more torment and anguish than the physical punishment or consequences for the crime. Tip: For enrichment, read the whole text of Crime and Punishment.\nIf he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be his punishment--as well as the prison…\nSiberia.  On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town, one of the  administrative centers of Russia; in the town there is a prison. In the  prison the second-class convict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for  nine months. Almost a year and a half has passed since his crime. There  had been little difficulty about his trial. The criminal adhered  exactly, firmly, and clearly to his statement. He did not confuse nor  misrepresent the facts, nor soften them in his own interest, nor omit  the smallest detail. He explained every incident of the murder, the  secret of the piece of wood with a strip of metal which was found in the  murdered woman’s hand. He described how he had taken her keys, what  they were like, as well as the chest and its contents; he explained the  mystery of Lizaveta’s murder; described how Koch and, after him, the  student knocked, and repeated all they had said to one another; how he  afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay and Dmitri shouting; how  he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards gone home…The sentence,  however, was more merciful than could be expected, perhaps partly  because the criminal had not tried to justify himself, but had rather  shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt.\n\n… In  prison, how it happened, he did not know. But all at once something  seemed to seize him and fling him at [Sonia’s] feet. He wept and threw  his arms round her knees. They were both pale and thin; but those sick  pale faces were bright with the dawn of a new future, of a full  resurrection into a new life…Under his pillow lay the New Testament. He  took it up mechanically. The book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from  which she had read the raising of Lazarus to him…But that is the  beginning of a new story--the story of the gradual renewal of a man, the  story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into  another, of his initiation into a new unknown life. That might be the  subject of a new story…\n \n    Literary Analysis- Prose Assignment Instructions\nInstructions\nYou will write a literary analysis paper on the text presented in the last page (click here to see the text).  In your paper, explore how the author conveys his rhetorical stance  that when someone commits a crime, a guilty conscience and un-confessed  sin cause more torment and anguish than physical punishment.  You may include other references in addition to your comments on this  excerpt.

They have grown children who live in another state. Jacqueline’s mother has moved in with the couple because she has Alzheimer’s disease. Jacqueline is an only child and always promised her mother that she would care for her in her old age. Her mother is unaware of her surroundings and often calls out for her daughter Jackie when Jacqueline is in the room. Jacqueline reassures her mother that she is there to help, but to no avail. \nJacqueline is unable to visit her children on holidays because she must attend to her mother’s daily needs. She is reluctant to visit friends or even go out to a movie because of her mother’s care needs or because she is too tired. Even though she has eliminated most leisure activities with Mark, Jacqueline goes to bed at night with many of her caregiving tasks unfinished. She tries to visit with her mother during the day, but her mother rejects any contact with her daughter. Planning for the upcoming holidays seems impossible to Mark, because of his wife’s inability to focus on anything except her mother’s care. \nJacqueline has difficulty sleeping at night and is unable to discuss plans even a few days in advance. She is unable to visit friends and is reluctant to have friends visit because of the unpredictable behavior of her mother and her need to attend to the daily care. \nReflective Questions \n1.

It says that the blow dryer uses state-of-the-art cool-wind technology to eliminate split ends and still dry your hair as fast as a traditional blow dryer. The company is pricing the product at $99 and expects to sell 8 million units in the first year after release. The estimated market size for the product is 64 million people.\nThe item will be sold to retail wholesalers for $50 each. Any amount that the customer would not pay from the $99 price tag would have to come off of the wholesale price. The company considers the product to be financially viable and worth the risk if it generates an estimated minimum profit margin of 20%.\nYou should answer the following questions:\n\nWill the $99 price tag allow the company to sell the 8 million blow dryers that it wants to sell?\n \nWill the price be high enough to allow for the company to make a 20% profit on the product?\n \n\nDiscussion 3\n  Be constructive and professional with Andrew and Charles post, advancing the conversation with questions and examples \n\nAndrew post\nGasoline operated automotive vehicles are a product that has been around for many years. The product lifecycle has shown to last over the decades and has transformed from primitive versions to much more advanced versions running off computerized systems. Even though the market is huge and still thriving today, there is a greater emphasis on renewable energy sources and the health of our planet. This has caused a ripple in the lifecycle and marketing of this product. Automotive makers are having to develop electric cars and cars that are safer for the environment. It does not look good for the lifecycle of our traditional combustion engines. One huge change already has been the hybrid cars running half combustion and half electric. The most recent has been electric cars like the Tesla models. More and more are seen on the roads today. This is forcing the marketing strategies to change and a change in the sales market of the product line. Due to the high cost of such products, it will be many years till the conversion but as with any new technology the market will have to change to meet the demands. This may happen quicker than expected. As written by CNN.com (2019), \"According to Bernstein, dramatic declines in the price of batteries will allow leading automakers to sell fully electric vehicles for less than cars powered by gasoline and diesel as soon as 2022.\"\n\nCharles post\nI actively work in research for a product called CoStar, which is a commercial real estate marketing and information service. Per QuickMBA, there are 4 stages in a product life cycle: Introduction, Growth, Maturity, and Decline. The product I work on was introduced in the late 1980's and quickly spread through the commercial real estate broker community. Deals were made with some of the largest brokerages to provide information and marketing services, but our information wasn't great yet and had a lot of gaps. Since the company going public in 1998, our product seems to be stuck in a perpetual growth phase. New features are added constantly, and the information the database contains is constantly being improved and updated by a team of over a thousand people. We don't have a lot of competition, mainly because we've gotten large enough as a company to purchase competitors outright if we can't beat their pricing or product.

He earns 20 points for each of the first 25 balls that he catches and 112 times the regular score for every additional ball that he catches. How many points does he earn for catching 30 balls?\nQuestion 2\nRead the scenario below and answer the questions that follow.\nThe XYZ Company has developed a new blow dryer. It says that the blow dryer uses state-of-the-art cool-wind technology to eliminate split ends and still dry your hair as fast as a traditional blow dryer. The company is pricing the product at $99 and expects to sell 8 million units in the first year after release. The estimated market size for the product is 64 million people.\nThe item will be sold to retail wholesalers for $50 each. Any amount that the customer would not pay from the $99 price tag would have to come off of the wholesale price. The company considers the product to be financially viable and worth the risk if it generates an estimated minimum profit margin of 20%.\nYou should answer the following questions:\n\nWill \tthe $99 price tag allow the company to sell the 8 million blow dryers that it wants to sell?\n \nWill \tthe price be high enough to allow for the company to make a 20% profit on the product?\n \n\nDiscussion 3\n  Be constructive and professional with Andrew and Charles post, advancing the conversation with questions and examples \n\nAndrew post\nGasoline operated automotive vehicles are a product that has been around for many years. The product lifecycle has shown to last over the decades and has transformed from primitive versions to much more advanced versions running off computerized systems. Even though the market is huge and still thriving today, there is a greater emphasis on renewable energy sources and the health of our planet. This has caused a ripple in the lifecycle and marketing of this product. Automotive makers are having to develop electric cars and cars that are safer for the environment. It does not look good for the lifecycle of our traditional combustion engines. One huge change already has been the hybrid cars running half combustion and half electric. The most recent has been electric cars like the Tesla models. More and more are seen on the roads today. This is forcing the marketing strategies to change and a change in the sales market of the product line. Due to the high cost of such products, it will be many years till the conversion but as with any new technology the market will have to change to meet the demands. This may happen quicker than expected. As written by CNN.com (2019), \"According to Bernstein, dramatic declines in the price of batteries will allow leading automakers to sell fully electric vehicles for less than cars powered by gasoline and diesel as soon as 2022.\"\n\nCharles post\nI actively work in research for a product called CoStar, which is a commercial real estate marketing and information service. Per QuickMBA, there are 4 stages in a product life cycle: Introduction, Growth, Maturity, and Decline. The product I work on was introduced in the late 1980's and quickly spread through the commercial real estate broker community. Deals were made with some of the largest brokerages to provide information and marketing services, but our information wasn't great yet and had a lot of gaps. Since the company going public in 1998, our product seems to be stuck in a perpetual growth phase. New features are added constantly, and the information the database contains is constantly being improved and updated by a team of over a thousand people. We don't have a lot of competition, mainly because we've gotten large enough as a company to purchase competitors outright if we can't beat their pricing or product. We've added ways for our clients to access the product, with Apple Store mobile apps, and we have Android apps in development. After over two decades the product doesn't seem to be slowing down, and is so unique within the industry that there isn't a need for differentiation.

Interdisciplinary aspects of doctor of nursing practice (DNP) work encourages the review of theories specific to the phenomenon” (p. 107). For this assignment, a review of biomedical science models and their application to nursing has been one of the focus. Theories from biomedical sciences include knowledge from biology, medicine, physiological and genomics/genetics, to name a few.\nDescribe one biomedical theory or model frequently used in health care and provide your rationale for how it relates to improved patient outcomes.\n     For this writing, genomic principles and theories as it applies to breast cancer are succinctly discussed.  Based on the World Health Organization (2002), Genomics differs from genetics in that genomics address all genes and their combined influences on the development of cancer or organism. Whereas, with genetics, the focus is on a specific gene ( Malon, 2009, p. 373).  Many diagnostic testing and therapeutic modalities have evolved related to the detection and treatment of breast cancer. Malon (2009) wrote that “genomics has added a new dimension to cancer risk assessment and nurses need to be prepared to integrate this new knowledge into practice” (p. 373). Borrowing from the field of biology, genetic, and technology, the medical community is consistently discovering new knowledge about cancer that is transforming the understanding of cancer diagnosis and treatment for many types of cancer. Identification of cancer makers and specificity of treatment based on the genetic makeup and interrelation of the cancer cells have played a role in targeted treatment and longevity of cancer survivors.  The caveat is that proper counseling by appropriate health care providers, educated in the field of genetics, should be in place at every testing and treatment cancer centers that provide genomic testing (Malon, 2009, p.374)\nDescribe one biomedical theory or model that is utilized in your specific practice area. Please provide at least two examples related to its application\n     I do not think that most nurses stop to think how much the nursing profession has borrowed theoretical concepts that originated from other disciplines, for example, germ theory and principles of infection posited by Louis Pasteur in 1858 (McEwen & Wills, 2019, p.). Many nurses in the medical units have cared for patients with respiratory airborne conditions who are placed in negative pressure rooms to stop the spread of the respiratory disease. Another example of germ theory and principles of infection is the act of proper hand hygiene.  Germ theory and principles of infection involve describing, understanding, and managing infectious disease (McEwen & Willis, 2019, p. 333) Nowadays, as society deals with the Covid-19 crisis, many of the testing and vaccines have evolved from the understanding of the cause, transmission, and treatment which falls under the auspice of the epidemiologic triangle. The epidemiologic triangle consists of three components which are the host, the agent, and the environment with regards to disease causation (McEwen & Wills, 2019, p. 334)\nReference\nMahon, S.M., (2009).

Louis Pasteur theorized that a specific germ is essentially responsible for producing an infectious process (McEwen & Wills, 2019). Subsequently, for an infection to occur, a host (germ) must be susceptible to the invasive organism (McEwen & Wills, 2019). Prevention strategies, such as adequate hand hygiene can help aid to putting a stop to the vicious cycle. \n            Furthermore, understanding the cycle of infection, essentially from the germ theory, helps one establish methods to help reduce the potential negative or less favored outcomes associated with infection. Aside from hand hygiene, aseptic technique when appropriate, and using adequate agents to clean surfaces of high traffic or high risk may also be imperative to promote better patient outcomes. Standard precautions with patient care have also been noted to reduce undesirable patient outcomes. \nGerm theory in the critical care setting \n      Areas such as the critical care setting are high-risk reservoir areas for infections; thus, exceptionally important to sanitize these areas appropriately. Examples of common-touch surfaces in the critical care setting may include but not limited to doorknobs, faucet handles, remote control devices, shared desks, telephones, light-switches, IV pumps, etc. All of which are high-risk of dissemination of infectious agents (Scott & et al., 2020). Implementing microbicides as routine practice in surfaces of high risk, will lead to better outcomes, by preventing nosocomial infections. \nAnother great example of the germ theory would be the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. As we are all very much familiar that the SARS-CoV-2 organism is a highly contagious organism and has spread rapidly globally.

Of course, we now have the vaccinations that have been rolled out, which hopefully can help slow things down to allow for better patient outcomes. \nReferences\nMcEwen, M., & Wills, E.M. (2019).

The Human Genome Project astonishingly mapped three billion base pairs of the human genome (Pestka et al., 2010). Genomics can pertain to all nurses in practice. By using genomics as a main focus for assessments, nurses’ plans of care for patients’ specific needs can be met. Specific assessments used include obtaining family history, updating a family pedigree, environmental factors that impact gene expression, signs and symptoms related to genomic conditions, and inquiring of what is known or desired to be known of genomic components in a condition (Pestka et al., 2010, pp.42-43). A nurse can utilize and incorporate genomic information for preconception and prenatal testing, newborn screening, disease susceptibility, and more (McEwin & Willis, 2019). Assisting in foreseeing a predisposed tendency towards a disease allows health care workers and patients to anticipate instances. Policies can be created to address areas in practice by recognizing preventative measures (Calzone et al., 2010). For example, in relation to pain as you discussed, a policy can be formulated using genomic approaches.\nReferences\nCalzone, K., Cashion, A., Feetham, S., Jenkins, J., Prows, C., Williams, J., & Wung, S.

Please check with your professor.\nScenarios\nChoose one of these professional scenarios from your Week 2 assignment:\nScenario 1\n\nSaban is a top-performing industrial equipment salesperson for D2D. After three years of working with his best client, he receives a text message from Pat, his direct manager, assigning him to a different account.\nPat has received complaints that Saban \"gets all the good clients\" and \"is not a team player.\"\nSaban responds to the message and asks for a meeting with Pat to discuss this change. Pat responds with another text message that reads “Decision final. Everyone needs to get a chance to work with the best accounts, so it is fair. Come by the office and pick up your new files.”\nMoments later, Saban sends a text message to Karen, his regional manager and Pat’s boss. It simply reads “We need to talk.”\n\nScenario 2\n\nAmber, Savannah, and Stephen work for Knowledge, Inc., a consulting firm. While on a conference call with Tim Rice Photography, an established client, the group discusses potential problems with a marketing campaign. Tim Rice, lead photographer and owner, insists the marketing is working and changes are not needed.\nAmber reaches over to put Tim on mute but inadvertently pushes the wrong button. She immediately says to Savannah and Stephen that the marketing campaign is not working and that “Tim should stick to taking pretty pictures.” Tim responds, “You know I can hear you, right?”\n\nScenario 3\n\nJames shows up to work approximately five minutes late one morning, walks silently and quickly to punch in at the time clock near the front desk.\nSarah, the front desk manager, says, \"Good morning, James,\" but James ignores her, punches in, and heads into the shop to his desk. Sarah rolls her eyes, picks up the phone, and dials the on-duty manager to alert her that James just arrived and should be reaching his desk at any moment.\n\nScenario 4\n\nPaul works for the website division of SuperMega retail company. He receives an email late Friday afternoon indicating that a new computer will launch at the end of next June and it will be in high demand with limited stock. The three-page message also indicates that customers will be able to preorder the item 30 days before launch, according to the production company. Paul is asked to create a landing page for consumers who are interested in learning more about the product.\nBy mistake, Paul sets up a page that allows customers to preorder product that afternoon, well in advance of the company authorized preorder period. Late Friday evening consumers begin to preorder the product.\nSharon, vice president of product sales at SuperMega, learns of the error Saturday morning and calls Paul to arrange a meeting first thing Monday morning. Sharon explains to Paul on the phone that the company intends to cancel all of the preorders, and Paul responds that the company should honor the preorders because it was not a consumer error. After a heated exchange, Paul hangs up on Sharon when she insists that the preorders will be canceled because of Paul’s error.\n\nInstructions\nUsing the guidelines outlined in Chapter 7, \"Delivering Bad-News Messages\" in BCOM 9th edition (pages 116–136), assume the role of a company manager and write a block business letter that provides bad news to the recipient, adhering to the following requirements:\n\nContent:\n\nAddress the communication issue from the scenario.\nProvide bad news from the company to the recipient.\nConcentrate on the facts of the situation and use the inductive or deductive approach.\nAssume your recipient has previously requested a review of the situation via email, letter, or personal meeting with management.\nInclude the proper introductory elements (sender’s address, date, recipient’s address).

Grabbing your laptop, you head to the meeting.\nIn the conference room, John is already waiting. He says, “We will be joined by the VP of HR and the managers of the Payroll and Training departments. Our focus will be on access to data that is housed in the HR database.”\nThe door opens and the other three attendees walk in.\nAmy Jones, the vice president of HR, begins: “The database that we use contains all employee data, ranging from payroll and benefits information to training and performance results. The issue that we are facing, and that I hope you can help us alleviate, is that all departments within Human Resources have full access to all of the data within the database.\n“Recently, it was brought to my attention that the training department has access to payroll data.”\nThe two managers glance at one another.\nJohn says, “I believe we can come up with a solution. As a matter of fact, this could be an opportunity to also evaluate the risk level that the HR database has from outside threats.”\nJohn turns to you: “I would like you to prepare a presentation for HR management. \n“In this presentation, you will suggest how we might limit access to specific types of data and protect vulnerable data from outside threats. Since we will be presenting to non-technical managers, you will need to explain the difference between authentication, authorization, and access control in plain language. The presentation will be scheduled in three weeks.”\nAfter the meeting, you realize that while you might understand the problems of data access, other employees may not be aware of the issues involving information access in an organization. Your presentation will have to be understood by employees who do not have an information technology background.\nOrganizations have two concerns surrounding access to data: They must limit access to data from outside the organization as well as control which people have access to what data within the organization. In this project, you will explain to management the difference between authentication, authorization, and access control, and suggest how to keep outsiders from getting in and keep insiders from getting data they shouldn’t.\nThis is the second of four sequential projects. During this project, you will research the models for authentication, authorization, and access control. You will also communicate the recommended solution to a nontechnical audience.\nThere are 13 steps in this project. Begin by reviewing the project scenario and then proceed to Step 1.\nCompetencies\nYour work will be evaluated using the competencies listed below.\n\n5.3: Support policy decisions with the application      of specific cybersecurity technologies and standards.\n6.2: Create an information security program and      strategy, and maintain alignment of the two.\n6.3: Integrate the human aspect of cybersecurity      into an organization's cybersecurity policy.\n9.3: Risk Assessment: Assess policies, processes,      and technologies that are used to create a balanced approach to      identifying and assessing risks and to manage mitigation strategies that      achieve the security needed.\n\nStep 1: Explore the Basics of Authentication\nIn order to build a presentation with the most current information available, you will gather information by reaching out to a group of your peers working in various industries. In the next three steps, you will prepare background information for this discussion.\n\nYou'll      need to have a basic understanding of authentication. Define      authentication and identify the core principles and key tenets of authentication as listed below. Review the      following topics: computer networks, network devices and cables, and network protocols.\nIdentify      the ways in which someone can be authenticated (e.g., userIDs, passwords).\nDescribe      how authentication has evolved over time and identify stressors that have      resulted in changes to authentication.\nIdentify      the different types of authentication (e.g., layered or two-factor),      compare and contrast their attributes, and give examples of each.\nCompare      and contrast single-factor and multifactor authentication.\n\nIn the next step, you will continue with your exploration of data access models with a look at authorization.\nStep 2: Explore the Basics of Authorization\nAnother topic you'll need to be prepared to discuss is authorization. Define authorization and differentiate it from authentication (similarities and differences). You will use the notes compiled in this step in your upcoming peer discussion. Complete each of the items listed below.\n\nDefine authorization      and identify examples of authorization schemes.\nDetermine      how access policies are used to express authorization rule sets. Identify      key principles of access policies.\nIdentify      the challenges that can arise when policies are used to maintain authorization      rules. Identify solutions to mitigate these challenges.\n\nIn the next step, you’ll complete your exploration of data access models with a look at access control.\nStep 3: Explore the Basics of Access Control\nOne last topic to prepare for the upcoming discussion is access control: Define access control and then differentiate between access control, authentication, and authorization. You will use the notes compiled in this step in your upcoming peer discussion. You should describe the different access control models and how they are used, including, but not limited to, the list below.\nAgain, review the following topics if needed: systems, utilities, and application software, interaction of software, and creating a program.\n\nRBAC: role-based      access control\nMAC: mandatory      access control\nABAC:      attribute-based access control\nIBAC: identity-based      access control\n\nAfter completing this step, you are ready for the next step, in which you will compile a report on the psychological aspects of cybersecurity.\nStep 4: Write a Social Psychology Report\nIn the previous steps, you explored the basics of authentication, authorization, and access control and common models of implementing them. Your next task in preparing for the discussion with your peers is to consider the impact that human factors, such as ethics, legal issues, and psychology have on cybersecurity.\nTo synthesize your research on these factors, you will write a report on the psychological aspects of cybersecurity. This report will be used to formulate recommendations later in the project and be included as an appendix to the final presentation in the last step of this project.\nIn this report, do the following:\n\nExplore      the typical intrusion motives/hacker psychology. Classify the types      of hackers and threat actors and give an example of a      potential incident.\nDefine a      cybersecurity policy as it relates to employees and employment. For      example, how would an organization apply a security policy to employees      and employment in relation to network-related programming or other      cyber-related positions?\nDefine      the separation of duties policy and give an example.\nDefine redundancy and diversity and explain how they relate      to cybersecurity access control. Give an example of a policy integrating      the concepts of redundancy and diversity to reduce risk.\nSummarize      how the implementation of the access control mechanisms mentioned in this      section may have a positive or negative consequence on employee      productivity.\nSuggested      length is four to six pages.\n\nSubmit the report for feedback.\nStep 5: Compose a Privacy Awareness Report\nFollowing the report on the impact of social psychology on cybersecurity, you will compose a report on privacy awareness and the implications on cybersecurity policy to further prepare for the discussion with your peers. This report will be used to formulate recommendations later in the project and be included as an appendix to the final presentation in the last step of this project.\nIn this report, complete the following:\n\nDefine ECPA (Electronic Communications Privacy Act)      and explain how it affects cybersecurity today. Give an example of how it      might come into play at your organization. Suggest how policy at your      organization could support ECPA compliance.\nDefine FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act)      and explain how it affects cybersecurity today. Give an example of how it      might come into play at your organization. Suggest how policy at your      organization could support FISA compliance.\nIdentify any other privacy law that may affect your      assigned organization. Give a brief summary of what the law does, how it      affects your organization, and how policy could support compliance.\n\nSubmit the report for feedback.\nSubmission for Privacy Awareness Report\nStep 6: Compile an Anonymity Report\nTo go along with the reports on the impact of social psychology on cybersecurity and the impact of privacy awareness on cybersecurity policy, you will now report on the implication anonymity has on cybersecurity by giving a brief one-paragraph summary on each of the items within the bulleted list below.\n\nEach summary should include a definition, and      explanation of how the term relates to the organization, and an      explanation of how you will integrate it into the policy recommendations.      This report will be used to formulate recommendations in Step 10 and be      included as an appendix to the final presentation in Step 12. Review introduction to the internet, a closer look at the World Wide Web, web markup languages, and web and internet services for basic information.\npseudonymity\nIP spoofing (IP spoofing and packet sniffing at the      network layer)\nemail protocols\nweb filters\ntypes of encryption\nremailers\n\nSubmit this report for feedback.\nSubmission for Anonymity Report\nStep 7: Create a Concept Map\nYou have explored and reported on the human aspects of cybersecurity. Chief information security officers frequently make security decisions in high-pressure environments and deal with individuals whose actions may violate certain standards of behavior and ethics. In this step, you will review several scholarly sources that discuss issues and concerns that a CIO and CIO staff may be faced with in the normal course of duties.\nAfter you have reviewed these materials, create a concept map of important issues, concerns, and best practices or model solutions to common problems. Your goal in creating this map is to develop a visual aid which can help decision makers identify important aspects of a cybersecurity issue revolving around human behavior as they seek to resolve the issues in a manner that is in keeping with an organization’s ethical standards and practices.\nReview the following scholarly sources:\n1.

Business Horizons (2020) 63, 9-16. https://doi-org.ezproxy.umgc.edu/10.1016/j.bushor.2019.04.005\nBuild Your Concept Map\nYou can use MS Word or PowerPoint to create your map using boxes, ovals, and connecting lines. Below are simple concept maps made using MS Word’s Smart Art. Your concept map should have between 15 to 20 concepts total.\nExample One:\n\n \n\nExample Two:\n\n \n\nNote: if you are not familiar with how to build a concept map and would like more information, see the following https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/how-to-make-a-concept-map\nStep 8: Assess Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control\nNow that you have explored authentication, authorization, and access control, you will direct attention to the specific issues of your assigned organization.\nIdentify particular issues that the organization has had, currently has, or could potentially have in terms of authentication, authorization, and access control. Next, assess the potential effectiveness of the access control models from Step 3 for the organization and scenario.\nDocument your assessment, as you will refer to this information throughout this project.\nCareer Connections\nIn many twenty-first century professions, expertise in your own field is not always enough. Sure, you are well on your way to becoming an expert in cybersecurity management. But the cybersecurity field exists so that professionals in other field can be confident that their computing platforms are safe. Knowledge of the types of information, processes, teams, and real-life activities that other professionals engage in is what will enable you to make the best decisions about how to ensure CIA on widely disparate platforms in different environments. \nIn the next step, you will look across your industry to determine best security practices.\nStep 9: Research Industry Best Practices\nIn the first three steps, you gathered information regarding authentication, authorization, and access control and had an opportunity to apply these concepts through training. You have thought about how to apply this knowledge to your organization, and you wrote reports on how psychology, anonymity, and privacy awareness affect cybersecurity. You are finally ready to meet with your peers in the industry to get a sense of current practices.\nThe peer discussion can take various shapes. Research online articles and/or interview colleagues, friends, and acquaintances in different fields to gather the most current information of what various industries are doing to face their cybersecurity needs. The information and ideas that you obtain here will help you to formulate a recommendation and develop a job aid for the human resources (HR) managers that John requested. You will need to at least cover the items in the list below.\n\nGive      examples of authentication, authorization, and access control that you      have seen in your experience, in your assigned organization, and/or in      research and interviews.\nDiscuss      what worked well and what could be improved.\nDiscuss      the role of policy in defining and implementing authorization schemes as      applied to your experience.\nApply key      points and principles in the NIST cybersecurity framework for virtual machine cybersecurity.\nAnalyze      the technologies, uses, and roles of information assurance and software      protection technologies.\nPrioritize      current cybertechnological threats faced at the enterprise, national, and      international levels.\nEvaluate      the procedures, policies, and guidelines used to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of      information (CIA triad).\n\nUse the information gathered here to assist in formulating your recommendations in the next step.\nStep 10: Formulate Recommendations\nFrom the information that you have gathered throughout this project, formulate a recommendation for authentication, authorization, and access control. If you determine that your organization needs no changes in these areas, explain your position and what leadership (and you, as CISO) will continue to monitor to ensure that security standards are commensurate with expectations.\nMake sure to consider the needs of restricting data from department to department as appropriate, protecting the organization’s HR data from outside and inside threats in general and allowing for employees to access the data they need while offsite. Also consider the human aspects of cybersecurity from the previous steps. Include a recommendation for an ongoing risk management strategy. You will include your recommendations in your Implementation Guidance Presentation in the last step.\nThe recommendation must meet the following criteria:\n\ncoincide      with IT vision, mission, and goals\nalign with      business strategy\nincorporate      all internal and external business functions\ncreate the      organizational structure to operate the recommendation and align with the      entities as a whole\n\nIn the next step, you will take your recommendations and use them to create a job aid for HR managers regarding authentication, authorization, and access control so they can spread the information to the various departments.\nStep 11: Develop a Job Aid\nNow that you have formulated your recommendation for authentication, authorization, and access control, you will develop a job aid that the HR managers can take to their departments after the presentation.\nThis job aid will empower the HR managers to educate their staff on the topics of authentication, authorization, and access control in a simple and effective way to improve the security of their systems. The job aid will be distributed after the presentation.\nDevelop a short (two- to three-page) job aid that explains the differences between authentication, authorization, and access control using common-sense examples to help the reader understand the differences and the importance of each in protecting the organization’s information. The job aid should address all the items listed below.\n\nDefine—in layman’s terms—authorization,      authentication, and access control, and the relationships between them.\nIdentify and articulate examples that are easy to      comprehend and that would resonate with the company’s leadership.\nDescribe the importance of authorization,      authentication, and access control to the overall security of the      organization. Use details of the company’s products/services and the need      to protect them to emphasize the need for strong controls.\n\nSubmit the job aid for feedback.\nSubmission for Authentication, Authorization & Access Control Job Aid\nProject 2: Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control\n Step 12: Develop the Implementation Guidance Presentation\nIn response to the request from the CTO and VP of HR, you will develop a presentation for HR management which discusses how to limit access to specific types of data and protect vulnerable data from outside threats. You will explain the lineage of data, data ownership, and data-access related authentication, authorization, and access control. You will also take this opportunity to educate on the basic principles of data/network access control and to advocate for stronger access controls.\nYou will develop an 18- to 20-slide presentation that clearly explains the principles of authentication, authorization, and access control, examines various models, and recommends a strategy for the organization. You will use the information that you have gathered in the initial steps of this project. Make sure to include the following:\n\nDescribe      authentication, authorization, and access control as an important security      concept.\nEvaluate      the different models and examples of authentication, authorization, and      access control.\nMake the      case for changes to the organization’s authentication, authorization, and      access control policies/systems.\nPresent      the recommended strategy.\nDiscuss      how you will evaluate the effectiveness of the security program.\n\nSubmit the presentation in the last step.\nStep 13: Check Your Evaluation Criteria\nYour presentation should include the following as appendices:\n\nSocial Psychology Report (Step 4)\nPrivacy Awareness Report (Step 5)\nAnonymity Report (Step 6)\nJob Aid (Step 11)\n\nCheck Your Evaluation Criteria\nBefore you submit your assignment, review the competencies below, which your instructor will use to evaluate your work. A good practice would be to use each competency as a self-check to confirm you have incorporated all of them.

But his latest venture is a start-up … for start-ups. Ahmed founded Innovation Pavilion, a business incubator in Centennial, Colorado (Denver’s Tech Center), in 2011. A typical business incubator provides start-up companies with workspace, mentoring, training, and sometimes a path to funding, but the Innovation Pavilion goes further.\nInnovation Pavilion (IP) is an 80,000 square foot “entrepreneurial ecosystem,” housing dozens of start-ups and renting out desks, office space, and event space. But it also hosts meetups, educational workshops, and a Toastmasters group designed specifically for entrepreneurs. It contains a maker-space (a workspace providing shared tools and manufacturing equipment for prototyping products) and encourages the growth of niche entrepreneurial communities based on specific industries. For example, IP has space for IoT (the Internet of Things), one for health care, and another for aerospace. These communities bring together people in an industry to learn from and collaborate with each other.\nWhile IP has a traditional incubator program, with companies housed within the IP campus, it has a semi-virtual hypergrowth accelerator program for more mature firms, too, which is open to companies around the country. It also seeks out educational partnerships, working with the Highland’s Ranch STEM program, for instance, and has its own educational spin-off, Xuno Innovative Learning, designed to help companies train their staff and find new employees with the skills they need. IP operates its own streaming TV service, filming educational events and interviews with entrepreneurs.\nInnovation Pavilion has national expansion plans—and several signed agreements with specific cities—targeting not the giant metropolitan areas but also second-tier and “ring” cities across the country, such as Joliet, Illinois, and Olathe, Kansas, smaller cities that don’t get the attention of the larger cities yet have plenty of educated and creative people.\nIP is in discussions with 20 cities around the nation, with the goal of building 200,000-square-foot campuses providing incubator services, office space, maker-space, education and training, outreach to young entrepreneurs, conference centers, retail space, and even housing. Entrepreneurs will be able to live and work in a space with everything they need, providing a complete entrepreneurial ecosystem in smaller cities across the nation.\nSteve Case, the co-founder of America Online (AOL), shares Vic Ahmed’s vision for entrepreneurship in mid- America. His “Rise of the Rest” bus tour has traveled 8,000 miles over the last three years, investing in local start-ups in 33 cities across the country. Case hosts a pitch competition with the best start-ups in each city, and one lucky winner receives a $100,000 investment from Case.\nMedia attention has focused on the entrepreneurial engines of America’s coastal cities, but Ahmed and Case have a more expansive entrepreneurial vision, in which smaller cities throughout the nation rise up alongside larger, start-up hot spots.\nCritical Thinking Questions\n\nWhat characteristics made Vic Ahmed a successful entrepreneur?\nHow did their Ahmed and Steven Case's partnership and shared vision of \"Rise of the Rest\" serve their business goals?\nIs focusing on smaller cities rather than areas like silicon valley a good strategy, why?",":slug12":"discussion-question-human-resource-management-homework-help-business-management-20",":category12":"Human Resource Management homework help",":tag12":"BUSINESS MANAGEMENT",":title13":"Emplyment - america",":excerpt13":"Your initial discussion thread is due on Day 3 (Thursday) and you have until Day 7 (Monday) to respond to your classmate",":body13":"Your initial discussion thread is due on Day 3 (Thursday) and you have until Day 7 (Monday) to respond to your classmates.

It wasn’t until 1970, however, when Malcolm Knowles coined the word andragogy to describe how adults learn, that we really started to think about how adult learning differs from the way children learn. Adults bring specific characteristics to the learning environment. They have life experiences that they want to be incorporated into their learning. They are motivated to learn when they have a problem to solve. Therefore, they are more interested in the specifics of a topic than in its generalities. For adults, being a learner is often not their primary role; it is secondary to their other life obligations. Combine these adult learner characteristics with their various learning styles, add a sprinkling of learning theories, and the result is a complicated mix that trainers must consider for the training to be well received and meet the needs of the adult audience (Gusdorf, M.L., 2009). As you can see there are a lot of things to take into consideration when developing a training program. \nUtilizing a needs assessment is important in order to gather the facts about training needs and approaches. A training needs assessment is conducted to identify the gaps between the employees’ actual performance and desired performance. Careful analysis of performance gaps determines what training needs to be done or if there is a need for training at all. In some cases, the performance gaps are not related to training deficiencies and other interventions may be needed (Gusdorf, M.L., 2009).\nContinue reading for your assignment instructions.\nInstructions\nThis week, time is of the essence. You will be creating a needs assessment which will consist of three (3) parts. 1) design the online needs assessment survey for your client  2) conduct the survey with 10-20 participants and 3) analyze your results. Your work will be submitted using Trello. See What is Trello? IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS on page one of this document for Trello tips.\nHere is a sample timeline to consider to complete this part of your project in one week:\n\nStep 1 Monday and Tuesday -read your textbook, design the needs assessment survey, and select 10-20 people who will participate. \nStep 2 Wednesday and Thursday - conduct the survey with 10-20 participants (1 must be your instructor)\nStep 3 Friday, Saturday, and Sunday - analyze your results and submit your work\n\nSteps:\n\n(15 points) Design the necessary online needs assessment survey for the organization you selected. \nGoogle Forms is recommended as an easy to use online survey assessment tool. It will gather all of your responses and create graphs, etc. for you. Click here to learn more about how to use Google Forms.\nSurveyMonkey is another online survey tool that is easy to use. Click here to learn more about using and to login to SurveyMonkey.\nKeep your assessment short for this project, remember you do not have a lot of time. We recommend no more than 15-20 questions, this includes any demographic questions you might ask.\nMake sure to include all resources utilized for your research, cite your sources. Put this information in the last question or the Confirmation Message at the end of your survey. \n(15 points) Next, you will conduct the needs assessment with at least 10-20 participants, they do not have to be employees of the organization. Participants can be your family, friends, employees of the organization if you know them, coworkers at another organization, anyone you know. However, one of the participants needs to be your instructor. Make sure to invite your instructor to participate in your needs assessment survey. Allow participants only 24 to 48 hours to complete your survey so you can thoroughly analyze the results.\n(20 points) Once your survey has closed it is time to analyze your results and determine what training program you will focus on developing for this organization. Create a PowerPoint or Google Slides presentation that details the results of the needs analysis. Include a slide for each of the following questions, make sure to include the question along with your response:\nHow many people were invited to participate in the needs assessment? How many people responded to the needs assessment? What percentage responded?\nWhat training needs have you identified?\nWho is the training audience? \nWhat, one, training will you focus on developing for the remainder of this project? Why did you select this training need over the others?\nAre there other issues identified that are not training issues? \nWhat advice as an independent training consultant would you give to Ryan regarding the non-training issues? \nIf you could implement any type of needs assessment instrument(s), not just a survey, within the organization which techniques from our textbook would you utilize? Explain your rationale. If you would only use a survey explain why. See the Noe textbook Chapter 3 Table 3.2 for examples. \nOptional - you are welcome to include any other interesting results from your needs assessment analysis that may be helpful for Ryan to consider.",":slug14":"needs-assessment-apa-format",":category14":"Human Resource Management homework help",":tag14":"APA Format",":title15":"English: Architecture and Design homework help - essay 21",":excerpt15":"Begin your board with an explanation of your topic and the information you've already found.

M. Pan National Real Estate Company to develop a model to predict median housing prices for homes sold in 2019. The CEO of D. M. Pan wants to use this information to help their real estate agents better determine the use of square footage as a benchmark for listing prices on homes. Your task is to provide a report predicting the median housing prices based square footage. To complete this task, use the provided real estate data set for all U.S. home sales as well as national descriptive statistics and graphs provided.\nDirections\nUsing the Project One Template located in the What to Submit section, generate a report including your tables and graphs to determine if the square footage of a house is a good indicator for what the listing price should be.

Is your sample representative of national housing market sales?\n\n\n\nDevelop Your Regression Model\n\nScatterplot: Provide a graph of the scatterplot of the data with a line of best fit.\n    \nExplain if a regression model is appropriate to develop based on your scatterplot.\n\n\nDiscuss associations: Based on the scatterplot, discuss the association (direction, strength, form) in the context of your model.\n    \nIdentify any possible outliers or influential points and discuss their effect on the correlation.\nDiscuss keeping or removing outlier data points and what impact your decision would have on your model.\n\n\nFind r: Find the correlation coefficient (r).\n    \nExplain how the r value you calculated supports what you noticed in your scatterplot.\n\n\n\nDetermine the Line of Best Fit. Clearly define your variables. Find and interpret the regression equation. Assess the strength of the model.\n\nRegression equation: Write the regression equation (i.e., line of best fit) and clearly define your variables.\nInterpret regression equation: Interpret the slope and intercept in context.\nStrength of the equation: Provide and interpret R-squared.\n    \nDetermine the strength of the linear regression equation you developed.\n\n\nUse regression equation to make predictions: Use your regression equation to predict how much you should list your home for based on the square footage of your home.\n\nConclusions\n\nSummarize findings: In one paragraph, summarize your findings in clear and concise plain language for the CEO to understand. Summarize your results.\n    \nDid you see the results you expected, or was anything different from your expectations or experiences?\n        \nWhat changes could support different results, or help to solve a different problem?\nProvide at least one question that would be interesting for follow-up research.",":slug5":"stats-project-math",":category5":"Mathematics homework help",":tag5":"math",":title6":"ldrs 302: Business & Finance homework help - Leadership 2",":excerpt6":"In the Roman Colony, leaders, or members of the court, were to be:\n•Local elites•Be freeborn•Between the ages of 2",":body6":"In the Roman Colony, leaders, or members of the court, were to be:\n•Local elites•Be freeborn•Between the ages of 22 – 55•Community resident•Moral integrity\nFrom the members, two were chosen as unpaid chief magistrates (Judges).

PMP?\nFundamentally, the PRINCE2 and PMP Certification involve two all completely different project management frameworks. Everyone provides a body of knowledge, and a tested approach to managing comes effectively. Selecting one over the alternative may be a decision that involves several factors. The most effective choice have to be compelled to be supported by the trade or company you are going to build a career in, and conjointly the design of the project you’re reaching to lead or direct.

Varied industries use PMP as a customary demand for project managers. Turning into a PMP empowers you to work with any methodology and in any trade. The certification course covers an oversized spectrum of project management techniques and competencies that unit of measurement necessary for any project manager and will facilitate increase your earning potential. This course, administered by PMI among the USA, has together gained quality in Europe and Asia.\nThe PMP Qualification\nIt is indicative of your proficiency in practice the PMBOK Guide, the Project Management Book of knowledge.\nVerifies your info concerning \"generally-accepted\" best practices and principles of project management.\nThe comes in Controlled Environments (PRINCE2) Certification.\nThe PRINCE2, or ‘Projects IN Controlled Environments' certification, maybe a process-based project management technique that provides a scientific approach to delivering a prosperous project with clear templates, processes, and steps. The certification is methodology and project-focused. PRINCE2 is run among the dominion by the APMG.\nThe PRINCE2 Qualification\nIt is a broad, high-level, general framework of project management principles that suggest it's urged for and will be implemented with relation to any project.\nHas a well-laid out and standardized approach to project management.\nSpells out the roles and responsibilities of each member of the team tasked with managing the project.\nDivides the master project started into project plans, stage plans, and team plans, which eliminates ambiguity and makes it easier to execute the project.\nIt is every project and methodology targeted.\nIndustry Demand\nIf you'd prefer to urge one in every one of these certifications, it's a necessity that you simply do your analysis before you begin to steer down one path vs. the other.

Also, one or two of trade sectors like PRINCE2 certification, whereas others just like the PMP certification.\nThe PMP certification is most well-liked among the USA, Canada, geographical region, and Australia. PRINCE2, however, is recognized among the dominion, Europe, and Australia.\nRegion-Wise Preferences of the Project Management Certification\nPRINCE2 Vs. PMP: pay Prospects\nSeveral studies and surveys show that certified professionals in project management earn way more than their non-certified peers. Having a project management certification, significantly ones like PRINCE2 and PMP, signifies that a person is responsive to and understands the universal language of project management.\nThe PMI Project Management pay Survey – Tenth Edition states that the salaries of project managers around the world still climb.\nIn the U.S. alone, the everyday annual pay of a licensed PMP is $112,000 p.a.

Grabbing your laptop, you head to the meeting.\nIn the conference room, John is already waiting. He says, “We will be joined by the VP of HR and the managers of the Payroll and Training departments. Our focus will be on access to data that is housed in the HR database.”\nThe door opens and the other three attendees walk in.\nAmy Jones, the vice president of HR, begins: “The database that we use contains all employee data, ranging from payroll and benefits information to training and performance results. The issue that we are facing, and that I hope you can help us alleviate, is that all departments within Human Resources have full access to all of the data within the database.\n“Recently, it was brought to my attention that the training department has access to payroll data.”\nThe two managers glance at one another.\nJohn says, “I believe we can come up with a solution. As a matter of fact, this could be an opportunity to also evaluate the risk level that the HR database has from outside threats.”\nJohn turns to you: “I would like you to prepare a presentation for HR management. \n“In this presentation, you will suggest how we might limit access to specific types of data and protect vulnerable data from outside threats. Since we will be presenting to non-technical managers, you will need to explain the difference between authentication, authorization, and access control in plain language. The presentation will be scheduled in three weeks.”\nAfter the meeting, you realize that while you might understand the problems of data access, other employees may not be aware of the issues involving information access in an organization. Your presentation will have to be understood by employees who do not have an information technology background.\nOrganizations have two concerns surrounding access to data: They must limit access to data from outside the organization as well as control which people have access to what data within the organization. In this project, you will explain to management the difference between authentication, authorization, and access control, and suggest how to keep outsiders from getting in and keep insiders from getting data they shouldn’t.\nThis is the second of four sequential projects. During this project, you will research the models for authentication, authorization, and access control. You will also communicate the recommended solution to a nontechnical audience.\nThere are 13 steps in this project. Begin by reviewing the project scenario and then proceed to Step 1.\nCompetencies\nYour work will be evaluated using the competencies listed below.\n\n5.3: Support policy decisions with the application      of specific cybersecurity technologies and standards.\n6.2: Create an information security program and      strategy, and maintain alignment of the two.\n6.3: Integrate the human aspect of cybersecurity      into an organization's cybersecurity policy.\n9.3: Risk Assessment: Assess policies, processes,      and technologies that are used to create a balanced approach to      identifying and assessing risks and to manage mitigation strategies that      achieve the security needed.\n\nStep 1: Explore the Basics of Authentication\nIn order to build a presentation with the most current information available, you will gather information by reaching out to a group of your peers working in various industries. In the next three steps, you will prepare background information for this discussion.\n\nYou'll      need to have a basic understanding of authentication. Define      authentication and identify the core principles and key tenets of authentication as listed below. Review the      following topics: computer networks, network devices and cables, and network protocols.\nIdentify      the ways in which someone can be authenticated (e.g., userIDs, passwords).\nDescribe      how authentication has evolved over time and identify stressors that have      resulted in changes to authentication.\nIdentify      the different types of authentication (e.g., layered or two-factor),      compare and contrast their attributes, and give examples of each.\nCompare      and contrast single-factor and multifactor authentication.\n\nIn the next step, you will continue with your exploration of data access models with a look at authorization.\nStep 2: Explore the Basics of Authorization\nAnother topic you'll need to be prepared to discuss is authorization. Define authorization and differentiate it from authentication (similarities and differences). You will use the notes compiled in this step in your upcoming peer discussion. Complete each of the items listed below.\n\nDefine authorization      and identify examples of authorization schemes.\nDetermine      how access policies are used to express authorization rule sets. Identify      key principles of access policies.\nIdentify      the challenges that can arise when policies are used to maintain authorization      rules. Identify solutions to mitigate these challenges.\n\nIn the next step, you’ll complete your exploration of data access models with a look at access control.\nStep 3: Explore the Basics of Access Control\nOne last topic to prepare for the upcoming discussion is access control: Define access control and then differentiate between access control, authentication, and authorization. You will use the notes compiled in this step in your upcoming peer discussion. You should describe the different access control models and how they are used, including, but not limited to, the list below.\nAgain, review the following topics if needed: systems, utilities, and application software, interaction of software, and creating a program.\n\nRBAC: role-based      access control\nMAC: mandatory      access control\nABAC:      attribute-based access control\nIBAC: identity-based      access control\n\nAfter completing this step, you are ready for the next step, in which you will compile a report on the psychological aspects of cybersecurity.\nStep 4: Write a Social Psychology Report\nIn the previous steps, you explored the basics of authentication, authorization, and access control and common models of implementing them. Your next task in preparing for the discussion with your peers is to consider the impact that human factors, such as ethics, legal issues, and psychology have on cybersecurity.\nTo synthesize your research on these factors, you will write a report on the psychological aspects of cybersecurity. This report will be used to formulate recommendations later in the project and be included as an appendix to the final presentation in the last step of this project.\nIn this report, do the following:\n\nExplore      the typical intrusion motives/hacker psychology. Classify the types      of hackers and threat actors and give an example of a      potential incident.\nDefine a      cybersecurity policy as it relates to employees and employment. For      example, how would an organization apply a security policy to employees      and employment in relation to network-related programming or other      cyber-related positions?\nDefine      the separation of duties policy and give an example.\nDefine redundancy and diversity and explain how they relate      to cybersecurity access control. Give an example of a policy integrating      the concepts of redundancy and diversity to reduce risk.\nSummarize      how the implementation of the access control mechanisms mentioned in this      section may have a positive or negative consequence on employee      productivity.\nSuggested      length is four to six pages.\n\nSubmit the report for feedback.\nStep 5: Compose a Privacy Awareness Report\nFollowing the report on the impact of social psychology on cybersecurity, you will compose a report on privacy awareness and the implications on cybersecurity policy to further prepare for the discussion with your peers. This report will be used to formulate recommendations later in the project and be included as an appendix to the final presentation in the last step of this project.\nIn this report, complete the following:\n\nDefine ECPA (Electronic Communications Privacy Act)      and explain how it affects cybersecurity today. Give an example of how it      might come into play at your organization. Suggest how policy at your      organization could support ECPA compliance.\nDefine FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act)      and explain how it affects cybersecurity today. Give an example of how it      might come into play at your organization. Suggest how policy at your      organization could support FISA compliance.\nIdentify any other privacy law that may affect your      assigned organization. Give a brief summary of what the law does, how it      affects your organization, and how policy could support compliance.\n\nSubmit the report for feedback.\nSubmission for Privacy Awareness Report\nStep 6: Compile an Anonymity Report\nTo go along with the reports on the impact of social psychology on cybersecurity and the impact of privacy awareness on cybersecurity policy, you will now report on the implication anonymity has on cybersecurity by giving a brief one-paragraph summary on each of the items within the bulleted list below.\n\nEach summary should include a definition, and      explanation of how the term relates to the organization, and an      explanation of how you will integrate it into the policy recommendations.      This report will be used to formulate recommendations in Step 10 and be      included as an appendix to the final presentation in Step 12. Review introduction to the internet, a closer look at the World Wide Web, web markup languages, and web and internet services for basic information.\npseudonymity\nIP spoofing (IP spoofing and packet sniffing at the      network layer)\nemail protocols\nweb filters\ntypes of encryption\nremailers\n\nSubmit this report for feedback.\nSubmission for Anonymity Report\nStep 7: Create a Concept Map\nYou have explored and reported on the human aspects of cybersecurity. Chief information security officers frequently make security decisions in high-pressure environments and deal with individuals whose actions may violate certain standards of behavior and ethics. In this step, you will review several scholarly sources that discuss issues and concerns that a CIO and CIO staff may be faced with in the normal course of duties.\nAfter you have reviewed these materials, create a concept map of important issues, concerns, and best practices or model solutions to common problems. Your goal in creating this map is to develop a visual aid which can help decision makers identify important aspects of a cybersecurity issue revolving around human behavior as they seek to resolve the issues in a manner that is in keeping with an organization’s ethical standards and practices.\nReview the following scholarly sources:\n1.

Below are simple concept maps made using MS Word’s Smart Art. Your concept map should have between 15 to 20 concepts total.\nExample One:\n\n\nExample Two:\n\n\nNote: if you are not familiar with how to build a concept map and would like more information, see the following https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/how-to-make-a-concept-map\nStep 8: Assess Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control\nNow that you have explored authentication, authorization, and access control, you will direct attention to the specific issues of your assigned organization.\nIdentify particular issues that the organization has had, currently has, or could potentially have in terms of authentication, authorization, and access control. Next, assess the potential effectiveness of the access control models from Step 3 for the organization and scenario.\nDocument your assessment, as you will refer to this information throughout this project.\nCareer Connections\nIn many twenty-first century professions, expertise in your own field is not always enough. Sure, you are well on your way to becoming an expert in cybersecurity management. But the cybersecurity field exists so that professionals in other field can be confident that their computing platforms are safe. Knowledge of the types of information, processes, teams, and real-life activities that other professionals engage in is what will enable you to make the best decisions about how to ensure CIA on widely disparate platforms in different environments. \nIn the next step, you will look across your industry to determine best security practices.\nStep 9: Research Industry Best Practices\nIn the first three steps, you gathered information regarding authentication, authorization, and access control and had an opportunity to apply these concepts through training. You have thought about how to apply this knowledge to your organization, and you wrote reports on how psychology, anonymity, and privacy awareness affect cybersecurity. You are finally ready to meet with your peers in the industry to get a sense of current practices.\nThe peer discussion can take various shapes. Research online articles and/or interview colleagues, friends, and acquaintances in different fields to gather the most current information of what various industries are doing to face their cybersecurity needs. The information and ideas that you obtain here will help you to formulate a recommendation and develop a job aid for the human resources (HR) managers that John requested. You will need to at least cover the items in the list below.\n\nGive      examples of authentication, authorization, and access control that you      have seen in your experience, in your assigned organization, and/or in      research and interviews.\nDiscuss      what worked well and what could be improved.\nDiscuss      the role of policy in defining and implementing authorization schemes as      applied to your experience.\nApply key      points and principles in the NIST cybersecurity framework for virtual machine cybersecurity.\nAnalyze      the technologies, uses, and roles of information assurance and software      protection technologies.\nPrioritize      current cybertechnological threats faced at the enterprise, national, and      international levels.\nEvaluate      the procedures, policies, and guidelines used to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of      information (CIA triad).\n\nUse the information gathered here to assist in formulating your recommendations in the next step.\nStep 10: Formulate Recommendations\nFrom the information that you have gathered throughout this project, formulate a recommendation for authentication, authorization, and access control. If you determine that your organization needs no changes in these areas, explain your position and what leadership (and you, as CISO) will continue to monitor to ensure that security standards are commensurate with expectations.\nMake sure to consider the needs of restricting data from department to department as appropriate, protecting the organization’s HR data from outside and inside threats in general and allowing for employees to access the data they need while offsite. Also consider the human aspects of cybersecurity from the previous steps. Include a recommendation for an ongoing risk management strategy. You will include your recommendations in your Implementation Guidance Presentation in the last step.\nThe recommendation must meet the following criteria:\n\ncoincide      with IT vision, mission, and goals\nalign with      business strategy\nincorporate      all internal and external business functions\ncreate the      organizational structure to operate the recommendation and align with the      entities as a whole\n\nIn the next step, you will take your recommendations and use them to create a job aid for HR managers regarding authentication, authorization, and access control so they can spread the information to the various departments.\nStep 11: Develop a Job Aid\nNow that you have formulated your recommendation for authentication, authorization, and access control, you will develop a job aid that the HR managers can take to their departments after the presentation.\nThis job aid will empower the HR managers to educate their staff on the topics of authentication, authorization, and access control in a simple and effective way to improve the security of their systems. The job aid will be distributed after the presentation.\nDevelop a short (two- to three-page) job aid that explains the differences between authentication, authorization, and access control using common-sense examples to help the reader understand the differences and the importance of each in protecting the organization’s information. The job aid should address all the items listed below.\n\nDefine—in layman’s terms—authorization,      authentication, and access control, and the relationships between them.\nIdentify and articulate examples that are easy to      comprehend and that would resonate with the company’s leadership.\nDescribe the importance of authorization,      authentication, and access control to the overall security of the      organization. Use details of the company’s products/services and the need      to protect them to emphasize the need for strong controls.\n\nSubmit the job aid for feedback.\nSubmission for Authentication, Authorization & Access Control Job Aid\nProject 2: Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control\nStep 12: Develop the Implementation Guidance Presentation\nIn response to the request from the CTO and VP of HR, you will develop a presentation for HR management which discusses how to limit access to specific types of data and protect vulnerable data from outside threats. You will explain the lineage of data, data ownership, and data-access related authentication, authorization, and access control. You will also take this opportunity to educate on the basic principles of data/network access control and to advocate for stronger access controls.\nYou will develop an 18- to 20-slide presentation that clearly explains the principles of authentication, authorization, and access control, examines various models, and recommends a strategy for the organization. You will use the information that you have gathered in the initial steps of this project. Make sure to include the following:\n\nDescribe      authentication, authorization, and access control as an important security      concept.\nEvaluate      the different models and examples of authentication, authorization, and      access control.\nMake the      case for changes to the organization’s authentication, authorization, and      access control policies/systems.\nPresent      the recommended strategy.\nDiscuss      how you will evaluate the effectiveness of the security program.\n\nSubmit the presentation in the last step.\nStep 13: Check Your Evaluation Criteria\nYour presentation should include the following as appendices:\n\nSocial Psychology Report (Step 4)\nPrivacy Awareness Report (Step 5)\nAnonymity Report (Step 6)\nJob Aid (Step 11)\n\nCheck Your Evaluation Criteria\nBefore you submit your assignment, review the competencies below, which your instructor will use to evaluate your work. A good practice would be to use each competency as a self-check to confirm you have incorporated all of them. To view the complete grading rubric, click My Tools, select Assignments from the drop-down menu, and then click the project title.\n\n5.3: Support policy decisions with the application      of specific cybersecurity technologies and standards.\n6.2: Create an information security program and      strategy, and maintain alignment of the two.\n6.3: Integrate the human aspect of cybersecurity      into an organization's cybersecurity policy.\n9.3: Risk Assessment: Assess policies, processes,      and technologies that are used to create a balanced approach to      identifying and assessing risks and to manage mitigation strategies that      achieve the security needed.\n\nSubmission for Implementation Guidance Presentation",":slug18":"organizational-industrial-assignment-business-finance-homework-help-original-4",":category18":"Business & Finance homework help",":tag18":"original",":title19":"bussines - Assignment help",":excerpt19":"includes the following:\n\nBusiness Case Investigation\nIdentify 4 employees to interview to support business analysis.

Emily will be undertaking the role of Service Manager and will be the force behind creating our new service department.\nEmily comes to us with 25 years of experience in the service repair industry. Emily began her career as a service technician and quickly moved through the ranks to the first female service manager in ABC Appliance Service Company's history. After 17 years, she went to work for Acme Appliance Repair. Over the last 8 years, the revenue for Acme increased by 200% after being stagnant for the preceding 5 years\nOur new service manager starts work today! This is great news! As our business starts to expand, we must move our software project along.\nneed to talk to some of our employees to better understand the functionality and requirements for the proposed system. This is important because they are the key stakeholders of the system.  list of employees who will want to interview.  learn the process for scheduling an appliance repair appointment and how the parts are obtained for those repair visits. Also, it is important to understand what reports that managers are hoping to extract from the new system. I find it is helpful to write down questions prior to your meetings as to not forget the topics that you want to cover.\nMy suggestion is at least 10 questions per person prior to the meeting. Make sure to use open-ended questions (at least 7 questions) to get the employees talking. Also use closed response and range of response questions. I find that each type of question can provide valuable information and are quite useful in requirements gathering.\nPlease send the questions to me for at least two of the interviews.\nWe have previously used both the Joint Application Development technique and the Rapid Application Development technique. However, many colleagues of mine swear by the agile technique. Each of these methodologies offer up some great advantages. Since we need to get this project done as quickly as possible, which of these techniques should be used? I want to ensure that we've created software that will handle all of our users' requirements and that it is a robust system\nI almost forgot to mention to also send a questionnaire out to the users of the proposed system.Should it be sent out to all employees or as a stratified or systematic sample?\n18 hours ago\ndepartment in order to get the service estimates out to the customer and get the parts for the repair quickly. Meredith Parks (programmer): I think it would be a good idea to name our new service system. Any ideas? Alan Marks (store mgr): Service Information System? SIS? Emily Johns (service manager): Service Information Manager? SIM? Meredith Parks (programmer): OK, let's vote. Meredith conducts a quick vote and all are agreed on SIM. Maddox Farley (parts director): I'm a little worried about how this SIM will affect my inventory levels. Meredith Parks (programmer): I need you to break this down a bit for me. Who is involved in this new process? Emily Johns (service manager): We definitely have the customers, parts department, parts, technicians, appointment setters, and calendar. Meredith Parks (programmer): OK, now we have our entities. What are the processes that will take place? Alan Marks (store mgr): Well, we will need to generate estimates and final invoices. Emily Johns (service manager): Right. And we'll make appointments, order parts, assign technicians to appointments. Meredith Parks (programmer): Anything else? Emily Johns (service manager): A calendar should be able to be viewed or printed for each technician. Each technician needs their daily schedule of appointments at the beginning of each day. Alan Marks (store mgr): I don't think so. Payment will be accepted by the current cashier's system. Meredith Parks (programmer): OK.\n18 hours ago\nQuestionnaire results Results are ordered by importance. The top result (#1) is the most important to that group. Most common features requested by appointment setters: Reminder services calls/messages See technician's availability Determination of discounts for customers See availability of parts to schedule repair View service history Most common features requested by technicians: Able to view own calendar See availability of parts to schedule repair Keep notes for each customer Mobile access of scheduling View service history Reminder services calls/messages Most common features requested by parts department: Can pull inventory requests every two hours. Database of requested parts. Most common features requested by management: Reporting by time period, type of appliance, brand Determination of discounts for customers Mobile access of scheduling Routing and mapping of technician's driving to appointments See technician's availability Suggest preventative maintenance to customers\nThe Appliance Warehouse is a facility that collects products and goods for the distribution to customers or other industries that may be able to use the products that are provided. The warehouse manager will be responsible for ensuring that all warehouse operations are done both effectively and efficiently by all staff involved with the said warehouse.\nThe case study concluded that millions of dollars are invested yearly purchase of materials and equipment needed for maintenance and development. The subsequent materials and equipment are then dispersed to three central warehouses and then shipped out to other warehouses and location sites as required. The management of the warehouse will be extremely important for this company as the warehouse will ensure maximum productivity with minimum investment through material handling and purchasing costs. An effectively managed warehouse will also be able to monitor the services and controls and even the flow of products. Being able to see what products the most demand and what products have can be scaled back a bit due to low demand. \nOne reason for the functional accuracy issues is that of poor skills training. The training requirements for store-related personal must be looked at in depth. All personnel that have any association with the warehouse both internal and external must undergo proper warehouse training. Training completion documents should be kept not only at the human resources office at the corporate office but also on hand at each of the individual stores. Some employees are not as proficient with the computer as they should be and must be trained adequately.\nWarehouse management is an integral part in most modern-day businesses. Warehouses of organizations if run and managed efficiently and effectively can serve as safe storage of goods, clear and transparent tracking and accountability at the organizational level. The effectively managed warehouse can also ensure the allocation of the right goods at the right time whenever needed to all client departments, maximum productivity with the least amount of expenditures through proper warehouse ordering. It will provide services and controls to the flow of goods entering and being dispersed by the company. \nExplanation:\nOrganizational Chart\nSWOT Analysis\nMission\n⦁ Organizations are committed to selling the most credible brands to the most competing products, avoiding the need for customer comparison shopping.\n⦁ By maintaining a considerate and low stress purchasing environment, their goal is to be the leading store for all home appliances needs.\nProblem Statement\n⦁ Providing Constant service\n⦁ Employee and Customer satisfaction\n⦁ Creation of a low-stress environment helps clients select the right products\nOpportunities\n⦁ Rapid adjustment to the changes\n⦁ Low startup costs\n⦁ Customization and catering to individual needs is possible\n⦁ Increase in responsiveness\n⦁ Improvement in reliability \n⦁ Improvement in productivity through balancing Benefits\n⦁ Bundling of product flows\nPRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION REPORT\nSubject:\nDate:\nINTRODUCTION \n[Provide a brief description of the system, the name of the person or group who performed the investigation, and the name of the person or group who initiated the investigation.]\nSYSTEMS REQUEST SUMMARY\n[Explain the basis of the systems request, including an explanation of major problems or opportunities mentioned in the request.]\nPRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION FINDINGS\n[Describe the results of the investigation, including the scope of the proposed project and the conclusions that were reached.

The role that HR plays during a merger is often complex and far reaching. In this assignment, you write an executive brief that considers aspects of how an HR department might prioritize and operate to support the union of two companies. \nPreparation\nHow to Brief an Executive\nThere is no single correct way to brief an executive or other stakeholder. The final deliverable is your choice, but effective briefs have common elements; they should be clear, concise, relevant, well-structured, and provide decision-making information. Here are a couple of resources you may use to get started:\n\nHow to Brief an Executive: A podcast from the Communications Guys. \nHow to Write a Formal Business Report (With Examples): Hints from Indeed.\nScenario\nImagine that Anchor Hospital, a 250-bed medical center, is merging with the similar-sized Saint Mary’s Hospital to better serve the needs of their metropolitan community. An administrative board has been formed to guide all aspects of the merger. They have asked all departments to submit an executive brief that states their roles, intended model of operations, and initial steps to build interdepartmental relationships. \nThe board’s primary concern for HR is how it will manage the merging of the workforces into a single, cohesive, and effective team. They want to understand HR's primary role, guiding principles, and application of current practice. Specifically, they want your vision for the following:\n\nA merger-related current best practice or trend that is being successfully employed by HR departments.\nHR’s primary role in assimilating the workforces for the two hospitals.\nThe HR management model to be followed.\nHow to foster relationships between HR and department managers.\nInstructions\nWrite a 3–4-page executive brief that address the following merger-related items: \n\n\nRecommend a relevant HR trend or practice that would be useful to consider as part of this merger. Justify your recommendation.\nAnalyze HR’s primary role(s) as a strategic corporate partner in merging the workforces of the organizations. \nRecommend an HRM model that would effectively steer the joining of each organization's employees into a single, cohesive workforce. Justify your recommendation.\nRecommend two initial steps that HR should initiate to develop an effective relationship between HR and management. Justify your recommendation.\nAdditional Requirements\n\n\n\nResources: Use four sources to support your writing. Choose sources that are credible, relevant, and appropriate. Cite each source listed on your source page at least one time within your assignment. For help with research, writing, and citation, access the library or review library guides.\nSWS: This course requires the use of Strayer Writing Standards.

Prepare a job order cost sheet by researching and identifying the top five ingredients and their estimated costs as your direct materials. Research and identify the cost of wages for your two employees as your direct labor. It typically takes two days to make 1,000 cookies.\nEstimate and explain the cost per cookie based on process costing with 40% conversion costs. Identify the top three processes you feel are needed to make the cookies and prepare a production cost sheet for one of those processes.\nEstimate and explain the sales price you plan to set per cookie based on the cost data.\n\nPart 3: Compare and contrast the costing methods used in this project, including which you believe provides the most useful information as a manager.\nPart 4: Discuss what will happen to revenue if the number of the cookies sold increases or decreases.\n\nTemplate below\nAbstract\nThe Abstract is an overview of the paper, written after completion.

Keep in mind that you are only making one type of cookie for this project. \nPart 2 Costing and Sales Information\nAnalyze and discuss the estimated cost per cookie using job order costing, the estimated cost per cookie using process costing, and the estimated sales price per cookie. Embed your spreadsheets to justify your costs.\nPart 3 Compare and Contrast Costing Methods\nAnalyze and discuss the major differences you see between the types of costing. Which do you believe is more useful for this business, and why? \nPart 4 Impact of Increase and Decrease in Sales\nDiscuss what will happen to revenue if the number of cookies sold increases or decreases. \nConclusions and Recommendations\nThe Conclusion section should summarize for the readers the topics of importance that led to your final conclusions/analysis regarding this case. Include some specific areas of focus from your analysis to reinforce your conclusion.\n  \nReferences\nInclude complete references in proper APA format for all of the citations listed in your paper.

You will select the article yourself by searching the UWA Library Databases. The article you choose should be a research article (has a hypothesis that is empirically tested). Pick an article relevant to a topic covered in the weekly readings. Each review is worth 20 points. The review should be 1-2 single-spaced pages in a 12-point font. It is in your best interest to submit your review before it is due so you may check your originality report and correct any spelling and grammatical errors identified by the software program. The purpose of the review is to provide students knowledge of how research is conducted and reported. The main part of your review needs to include the following information. Please comment on these aspects of the article as part of your review. Provide only the briefest summary of content. What I am most interested in is your critique and connection to weekly readings. Reference. Listed at the top of the paper in APA style. Introduction. Read the introduction carefully. The introduction should contain:· A thorough literature review that establishes the nature of the problem to be addressed in the present study (the literature review is specific to the problem)· The literature review is current (generally, articles within the past 5 years)· A logical sequence from what we know (the literature review) to what we don't know (the unanswered questions raised by the review and what this study intended to answer· The purpose of the present study· The specific hypotheses/research questions to be addressed. \n\nState the overall purpose of the paper. What was the main      theme of the paper? \nWhat      new ideas or information were communicated in the paper? \nWhy was it important to publish these ideas? \n\nMethods. The methods section has three subsections. The methods sections should contain: · The participants and the population they are intended to represent (are they described as well in terms of relevant demographic characteristics such as age, gender, ethnicity, education level, income level, etc?).· The number of participants and how the participants were selected for the study· A description of the tools/measures used and research design employed. · A detailed description of the procedures of the study including participant instructions and whether incentives were given.Results. The results section should contain a very thorough summary of results of all analyses. This section should include: · Specific demographic characteristics of the sample· A thorough narrative description of the results of all statistical tests that addressed specific hypotheses· If there are tables and figures, are they also described in the text?· If there are tables and figures, can they be interpreted \"stand alone\" (this means that they contain sufficient information in the title and footnotes so that a reader can understand what is being presented without having to go back to the text)?Discussion. The discussion is where the author \"wraps up the research\". This section should include: · A simple and easy to understand summary of what was found· Where the hypotheses supported or refuted?· A discussion of how the author's findings compares to those found in prior research· The limitations of the study· The implications of the findings to basic and applied researchers and to practitioners Critique.In your opinion, what were the strengths and weaknesses of the paper or document? Be sure to think about your impressions and the reasons for them. Listing what the author wrote as limitations is not the same thing as forming your own opinions and justifying them to the reader. · Were the findings important to a reader? · Were the conclusions valid? Do you agree with the conclusions? · If the material was technical, was the technical material innovative? Conclusion.Once you provide the main critique of the article, you should include a final paragraph that gives me your overall impression of the study. Was the study worthwhile? Was it well-written and clear to those who may not have as much background in the content area? What was the overall contribution of this study to our child development knowledge base?  APA Format ReviewIf you are unfamiliar or a bit “rusty” on your APA format, you may want to use the tutorial available through the APA website which is listed on your syllabus.

The director of communication’s objective is to retrieve and evaluate all information for accuracy and company regulations before it is released to the press. As the Director of Communications, I feel I can control what information I want to give to the media if its within ethical guidelines. As the public communicator, I can recommend to my employees and department what information can and to whom it should be released. Individuals must be wise regarding information that is distributed to agencies, internet and social media. The role is to ensure that all messages are consistent and conscientiously worded to make sure there is no potential negative impacts. I will not be intimidated and will dictate the flow of information always given regardless of the pressure by media. Additional information will not be disclosed unless it is beneficial to county business.  “If given authority as the PIO, you can limit or increase access to agency people and to news that is not printed or distributed to all media, even to the extremes of outright favoritism or freezing out certain media” (Lee, Neeley, & Stewart, 2012). My boss should be mindful that I have a duty to perform and will not jeopardize my employment for opinions on stereotyping. My boss should feel confident of my capabilities with the education, experience and knowledge I possess. Serving as the liaison for the county communication I will volunteer to speak at press conferences and interviews on behalf of my boss if requested. \nReferences\nLee, M., Neeley, G., & Stewart, K.

They have grown children who live in another state. Jacqueline’s mother has moved in with the couple because she has Alzheimer’s disease. Jacqueline is an only child and always promised her mother that she would care for her in her old age. Her mother is unaware of her surroundings and often calls out for her daughter Jackie when Jacqueline is in the room. Jacqueline reassures her mother that she is there to help, but to no avail. Jacqueline is unable to visit her children on holidays because she must attend to her mother’s daily needs. She is reluctant to visit friends or even go out to a movie because of her mother’s care needs or because she is too tired. Even though she has eliminated most leisure activities with Mark, Jacqueline goes to bed at night with many of her caregiving tasks unfinished. She tries to visit with her mother during the day, but her mother rejects any contact with her daughter. Planning for the upcoming holidays seems impossible to Mark, because of his wife’s inability to focus on anything except her mother’s care. Jacqueline has difficulty sleeping at night and is unable to discuss plans even a few days in advance. She is unable to visit friends and is reluctant to have friends visit because of the unpredictable behavior of her mother and her need to attend to the daily care. \nReflective Questions\n 1.

I know that the math classes that are required for my Natural Science degree will become useful in future classes I take, especially those with lab requirements.\nFor me, the discussion posts were very useful as it allowed me to see how other individuals approached each weeks work and sometimes those posts shed new light on the subject making it easier for me to understand the weeks work.\nFrom here, I am keeping up my trend of taking two classes at a time, this starting semester I will begin Chemisty (with Lab) and Biology (with lab). Both of these classes are 16 weeks long and begin the day after this class and my Physical Geography class close this Sunday. Now with Statistics and Physical Geography completed I am over 50% complete with my degree.\nAgain, congrats to everyone for making it this far in the class and good luck on your last week’s tests and the final paper. For those of you who have more classes, keep going strong.\nThomas\nRESPONSE 2:\nWhich resources did you like best? Why?\nMy favorite resources were the ones that were attached to our discussion each week. Those helped me the most when it came to prepping for the homework quizzes and tests.\nHow will you use the information in the future? This is your opportunity to consider--and then share--how you will employ the knowledge that you have gained during our course.\nThe information I learned in this class won’t make its way into my everyday life but I can see where I would use this knowledge to make big purchases in my life. I can use statistics when comparing potential vehicles, houses, and even stocks if I were inclined to invest in the stock market.\nWere the discussions useful?  Will they be useful for you in real life?  Why or why not?\nI found the discussions very helpful in the course because it allowed me to apply the new concepts learned each week. That was helpful when it came to the homework and test each week. I can only speak for myself but those homework quizzes and tests were no joke. I needed all the help I could get.\nWhere are you going from here? What course(s) do you plan to take next?\nThis is the first time I’m saying this at the end of a course, but I’m not signed up for any other classes after this one concludes. I am due to have my second baby in roughly 40 days and this mama needs a break. I need to rest and prep for having another baby. I plan to take about 4 months off from school while I acclimate to having a second baby and see how that is going to alter my daily schedule. I plan to start classes back up again in July/August. At that time, I will be taking BUSN312 - Operations Research and BUSN313 - Global and Competitive Strategy. I have eight classes plus my senior seminar left until I finish my degree. I’m sad to be taking a break because I could be done with my degree by the end of this year. I know I’ll need the break though.\nFeel free to share something interesting about yourself and/or how it relates to the course. \nI don’t have anything interesting about myself that pertains to statistics.\nSomething interesting about myself just in general though, is that I can solve a regular Rubix cube in under a minute. I have a Rubix obsession. I have a pyramix (pyramid one), a 5x5 Rubix cube, as well as a 12-Sided Megaminx (it has 12 pentagons). The pyramid one is the easiest one to solve, but the other two take me a while to solve. There are a lot of algorithms to remember with those.\nDoes anyone else know how to solve the Rubix cube?\nIt was great conversing with everyone throughout this course and it was great that we could rely on each other to check our math.\n- Emily",":slug8":"how-will-you-use-statistics-responses-statistics",":category8":"Mathematics homework help",":tag8":"statistics",":title9":"Article Summary 1500 words - APA",":excerpt9":"For the second assignment students are individually responsible for writing a practice summary of an academic research a",":body9":"For the second assignment students are individually responsible for writing a practice summary of an academic research article.

From this data, create scatterplots, histograms, and calculate the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of some data points. Write a 3-5-page report including the graphs and descriptive statistics you have created.\nBusiness analytics techniques are used to facilitate decision making by transforming large amounts of raw data into meaningful information. Many businesses rely on analysis of relevant historical data to make key strategic and operational decisions. Therefore, understanding how to use techniques such as graphical representation and descriptive statistics to translate raw data into useful information can be a valuable skill in an organization.\nIn this assessment and the next, you will have the opportunity to sharpen your analytics skills by locating and interpreting real-life stock data. \nYou have been learning about how to explore data. In this assessment, you will apply those skills by downloading a practical dataset and creating graphical representations of that data. The work you do in this assessment will lay the foundation for future assessments in which you analyze and interpret those graphical representations. Since the purpose of business analytics is to make sense of large quantities of raw data, this assessment helps you develop skills in applying analytics to business contexts by practicing the exploration and display of data.\nIn addition to graphical and tabular summary methods, numeric or quantitative variables and data can be summarized numerically using various techniques of description and display.\nDescriptive methods, which describe existing data, are also methods for using a subset of the available data to estimate or test a theory about a measurement on a larger group. This larger group is called the population, and the measurement being studied is the parameter. The smaller group, or subset, of the population that is taken in order to make an inference (to make an estimate or test a theory) is referred to as the sample. The measurement taken on that sample is then referred to as the statistic, which is usually the best single-number estimate for the population parameter of interest. Most often, however, the estimate should not be restricted to a single number that would be exactly correct or incorrect. Instead, it is preferable to calculate some range of possible values between which there can be a certain percent confidence that the true population parameter falls. These are referred to as confidence intervals.\nYou are an analyst in a publicly traded company. Your supervisor has asked you to create graphical representations from raw stock data for a company-wide meeting at the end of the quarter.\nYour Role\nYour task is to analyze the stock history of the company and create a scatterplot and a histogram.

The second step is interpreting and explaining those graphs and statistics in order to apply them in the business context. \nIn the previous assessment, you were asked to create the first part of your analytics report by preparing graphs and calculating some descriptive statistics. In this assessment, you will complete your analytics report by interpreting those graphs and statistics, and connecting those interpretations explicitly to implications in the business context.  \nIn business and applied analytics, oftentimes you are interested in drawing conclusions about a population of interest. However, it may not be feasible or practical to gather data on the entire population. In those cases, data is gathered from a sample or subset of the population. Analyses done on the sample are then used to draw inferences regarding the overall population; this mathematic process is referred to as inferential statistics. In this assessment, we begin discussing the topics of sampling and drawing inferences.  \nAll the inferential statistical techniques and methods covered in this course are considered parametric techniques and require certain assumptions to be used and for the results to be reliable, many of which are assumptions about an underlying distribution. Nonparametric techniques require no assumption about underlying distributions and are often used when the assumptions of parametric techniques are not met. Although these are beyond the scope of this introductory course, they are a great option for additional reading and research. \nAnalytics projects often result in two distinct types of reports or summaries: one tailored to the executive level, which takes the form of a presentation, and the other, a detailed analytics report, which documents an analysis so thoroughly that another analyst can reproduce the analysis exactly. Many times, the latter type is referred to by other departments or analysts wishing to conduct a similar analysis on similar data or by the same analyst who wants to repeat the analysis on a new or revised set of data. In this assessment, you will learn the essential elements that should be included in a report at this level of detail and you will create your own analytics report addressing the business problem you have been working on.\nScenario\nYour supervisor has asked you to prepare a report for the quarterly company meeting. The first part of the task was to download the data and create scatterplots and histograms, and to calculate mean, median, and mode of the stock prices that you presented graphically in your report for the last assessment. This time your task is to analyze and interpret those graphical representations of the company stocks and to write a report about your findings for your supervisor. \nYour Role\nYou are an analyst in the same business that you used for the last assessment.

Managers are often required to present the results of their team’s analysis to executives and must be able to explain the results at a high level as well as understand enough about the details to answer any questions the executives might pose.\nHow much an analysis is valued can depend heavily on how well the results of that analysis are articulated. Communicating the results of your data analysis so the applications to your business are clear and explicit can greatly enhance the value of your analytic work. In this assessment, consider how you can best communicate the results that you wrote about in your previous assessment.

She had been suffering from emphysema for several years and had had frequent hospitalizations for respiratory problems. On the last hospital admission, her pneumonia quickly progressed to organ failure. Death appeared to be imminent, and she went in and out of consciousness, alone in her hospital room. The medical-surgical nursing staff and the nurse manager focused on making Mrs. Smith’s end-of-life period as comfortable as possible. Upon consultation with the vice president for nursing, the nurse manager and the unit staff nurses decided against moving Mrs. Smith to the palliative care unit, although considered more economical, because of the need to protect and nurture her because she was already experiencing signs and symptoms of the dying process. Nurses were prompted by an article they read on human caring as the “language of nursing practice” (Turkel, Ray, & Kornblatt, 2012) in their weekly caring practice meetings.\n\nThe nurse manager reorganized patient assignments. She felt that the newly assigned clinical nurse leader who was working between both the medical and surgical units could provide direct nurse caring and coordination at the point of care (Sherman, 2012). Over the next few hours, the clinical nurse leader and a staff member who had volunteered her assistance provided personal care for Mrs. Smith. The clinical nurse leader asked the nurse manager whether there was a possibility that Mrs. Smith had any close friends who could “be there” for her in her final moments. One friend was discovered and came to say goodbye to Mrs. Smith. With help from her team, the clinical nurse leader turned, bathed, and suctioned Mrs. Smith. She spoke quietly, prayed, and sang hymns softly in Mrs. Smith’s room, creating a peaceful environment that expressed compassion and a deep sense of caring for her. The nurse manager and nursing unit staff were calmed and their “hearts awakened” by the personal caring that the clinical nurse leader and the volunteer nurse provided. Mrs. Smith died with caring persons at her bedside, and all members of the unit staff felt comforted that she had not died alone.\n\nDavidson, Ray, and Turkel (2011) note that caring is complex, and caring science includes the art of practice, “an aesthetic which illuminates the beauty of the dynamic nurse-patient relationship, that makes possible authentic spiritual-ethical choices for transformation—healing, health, well-being, and a peaceful death” (p. xxiv). As the clinical nurse leader and the nursing staff in this situation engaged in caring practice that focused on the well-being of the patient, they simultaneously created a caring-healing environment that contributed to the well-being of the whole—the emotional atmosphere of the unit, the ability of the clinical nurse leader and staff nurses to practice caringly and competently, and the quality of care the staff were able to provide to other patients. The bureaucratic nature of the hospital included leadership and management systems that conferred power, authority, and control to the nurse manager, the clinical nurse leader, and the nursing staff in partnership with the vice president for nursing. The actions of the nursing administration, clinical nurse leader, and staff reflected values and beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors about the nursing care they would provide, how they would use technology, and how they would deal with human relationships. The ethical and spiritual choice making of the whole staff and the way they communicated their values both reflected and created a caring community in the workplace culture of the hospital unit. \n1. What caring behaviors prompted the nurse manager to assign the clinical nurse leader to engage in direct caring for Mrs. Smith? Describe the clinical nurse leader role established by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing in 2004.\n2. What issues (ethical, spiritual, legal, social-cultural, economic, and physical) from the structure of the theory of bureaucratic caring influenced this situation? Discuss end-of-life issues in relation to the theory.\n3. How did the nurse manager balance these issues? What considerations went into her decision making? Discuss the role and the value of the clinical nurse leader on nursing units. What is the difference between the nurse manager and the clinical nurse leader in terms of caring practice in complex hospital care settings? How does a clinical nurse leader fit into the theory of bureaucratic caring for implementation of a caring practice?\n4. What interrelationships are evident between persons in this environment—that is, how were the vice president for nursing, nurse manager, clinical nurse leader, staff, and patient connected in this situation?

The virus usually enters the body through broken skin and mucus membranes and can range from severe to fatal (Centers for Disease Control, 2015).\n                                                Preparedness and public health policies that address the emergency\nThe 2014-2015 West African Ebola outbreak was responsible for 11, 325 deaths worldwide (CDC, 2019). The first case was identified in Guinea December of 2013 and by September 2014, it had reached the shores of the United States. The Centers for Disease Control responded quickly to the emerging outbreak in West Africa by activating its Emergency Operations Center in July 2014, to coordinate disease efforts with local and global partners. The CDC trained 6, 500 healthcare professionals in the United States and 24, 655 in West Africa on how to care for patients with EVD as they were the most likely to contract the virus by caring for the infected (CDC, 2019). There was screening done at airports in West Africa and the United States in order to prevent the virus from spreading to other countries. Even with these efforts, the disease managed to spread to a few countries in limited quantities. The screening policies adopted by airports in West Africa played an important part of minimizing the spread of this deadly virus to the rest of the world. The 2018 National Biodefense Strategy outlines the course for the United States to combat the biological treats (natural or otherwise) that the country may face (phe.gov, 2020).  It aims to reduce the impact of bio-incidents by improving communication and reaction time to the threat. As a national effort, the National Biodefense Strategy requires the participation of local, state, federal, Tribal, community, physicians and practitioners in order for it to be successful and beneficial. \n                                            Analyze local, state and federal agencies in addressing this emergency\nIn the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services is usually responsible for responding to biological disasters. The CDC often plays a leading role as they are experts in the field of infectious diseases and pathogens. The CDC works with local governments to get pertinent information to the people in the community in order to keep them safe. As mentioned previously, the CDC activates its Emergency Operations Center when it is required for health emergencies and outbreaks either local or abroad. In June 2019, the CDC activated its Operations Center to assist with the Ebola outbreak in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (CDC, 2020). The activation possibly stopped the spread of the virus and saved many lives. The CDC is capable of working with many world governments in an effort to reduce and prevent biological outbreaks that threaten lives. The National Incident Management System (NIMS) is mostly mobilized with natural disasters in order to render aid to individuals. They have many resources and are able to mobilize medical professionals and social workers alike if they are required for that situation.\n                                                                  One change to improve preparedness policies\nI believe that more TV and radio advertisements on the dangers of EVD would be beneficial to slowing the spread of the virus in the case of an outbreak. Increasing the health education and literacy of the population will arm people with the knowledge they need to protect themselves and their families. Health literacy has been associated with better self-care but unfortunately the information available is insufficient or inadequate (Castro-Sanchez et al, 2015). Making the information easy to understand by using familiar language will be beneficial to the public and will likely lead to widespread compliance. Including information about early surveillance can be a game changer in the amount of people infected by the virus. If people know that multiple animals dying suspiciously in a precursor to an outbreak then they will be more cautious. \nThe state and federal government should also make the information on diseases available before there is an outbreak as a preventative method. If they provide the information in layman terms in multiple languages and in American Sign Language, then people will be prepared in case of an outbreak.",":slug10":"post-5-apa",":category10":"English homework help",":tag10":"APA",":title11":"ADVANCED EXCEL - EXCEL",":excerpt11":"-The Anchoring exercise is on slides 28-31\n-The Pivot Table exercise is on Slide 45 of the Advanced Excel PPT.

With the outbreak and continuing rise of the COVID-19 virus, I thought it would be important to understand what is done in the even of a pandemic. Newton County works closely with other public health agencies both within the state and nationwide, a major one being the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, in providing information and recommendations about how to curb the spread of the virus (Georgia Department of Public Health, 2020).\nIn the midst of a pandemic, there are a few public health policies and regulations in place with the intent to protect public health. Using COVID-19 as an example, there has been the adoption of a mask ordinance for persons over 8 years of age within government buildings as well as public areas (Newton County, 2020). There was also a shelter in place ordinance and closing of non-essential businesses signed by Georgia governor Kemp in order to deter the spread of the virus as well. While Newton County is a bit more open with their businesses, there are still a few that are required to stay closed where social distancing is difficult to do. Finally, Newton County’s public health department works alongside government authorities and other public health agencies in keeping the public informed and providing recommendations on topics such as handwashing, properly wearing a mask, social distancing, and quarantining when necessary (Ready.gov, 2020).\n When it comes to a pandemic, it is something that is addressed by all levels of government: local, state, and federal. Each of these levels work in tandem to develop policies, rules, and regulations to be followed nationwide and within states, counties, cities, and towns. The CDC has provided a framework of 15 national capabilities for each of these levels, including tribal and territorial, to plan, operationalize, respond to and recover from outbreaks and other preparedness response emergencies. They include topics such as preparedness, recovery, information sharing, medical dispensing/administration/distribution, and public health laboratory testing, just to name a few (CDC, 2019). Another major organization to be utilized would include the National Emergency Managements Systems (NIMS). NIMS works with every type of government, non-government organization, and private sector to prevent, protect against, and respond/recover from emergency situations (FEMA, 2021).\nLooking at a growing pandemic, public health agencies across the nation have worked tirelessly with other organizations both governmental and non-governmental in efforts to further protect public health. This includes making guidelines and recommendations which can lead to and influence policy and law-making decisions among authorities with the power to do so. I believe improvements should be made towards those in more underserved, impoverished communities. These communities are more vulnerable to the spread of disease due to issues such as housing circumstances, potential problems with overcrowding, and financial constraints. They may not be able to get purchase to personal protective equipment such as masks, gloves, or face shields. Being at a disadvantage in these regards leads to little to no treatment and increased risk of worsening outbreaks. Being able to develop more focus and care towards these communities would be a great start towards curbing the spread of infection.",":slug12":"post-6-apa",":category12":"English homework help",":tag12":"APA",":title13":"Discussion 2 - Serving in Maine - psychology",":excerpt13":"Discuss each question in 1-2 paragraphs.

She had been suffering from emphysema for several years and had had frequent hospitalizations for respiratory problems. On the last hospital admission, her pneumonia quickly progressed to organ failure. Death appeared to be imminent, and she went in and out of consciousness, alone in her hospital room. The medical-surgical nursing staff and the nurse manager focused on making Mrs. Smith’s end-of-life period as comfortable as possible. Upon consultation with the vice president for nursing, the nurse manager and the unit staff nurses decided against moving Mrs. Smith to the palliative care unit, although considered more economical, because of the need to protect and nurture her because she was already experiencing signs and symptoms of the dying process. Nurses were prompted by an article they read on human caring as the “language of nursing practice” (Turkel, Ray, & Kornblatt, 2012) in their weekly caring practice meetings.\nThe nurse manager reorganized patient assignments. She felt that the newly assigned clinical nurse leader who was working between both the medical and surgical units could provide direct nurse caring and coordination at the point of care (Sherman, 2012). Over the next few hours, the clinical nurse leader and a staff member who had volunteered her assistance provided personal care for Mrs. Smith. The clinical nurse leader asked the nurse manager whether there was a possibility that Mrs. Smith had any close friends who could “be there” for her in her final moments. One friend was discovered and came to say goodbye to Mrs. Smith. With help from her team, the clinical nurse leader turned, bathed, and suctioned Mrs. Smith. She spoke quietly, prayed, and sang hymns softly in Mrs. Smith’s room, creating a peaceful environment that expressed compassion and a deep sense of caring for her. The nurse manager and nursing unit staff were calmed and their “hearts awakened” by the personal caring that the clinical nurse leader and the volunteer nurse provided. Mrs. Smith died with caring persons at her bedside, and all members of the unit staff felt comforted that she had not died alone.\nDavidson, Ray, and Turkel (2011) note that caring is complex, and caring science includes the art of practice, “an aesthetic which illuminates the beauty of the dynamic nurse-patient relationship, that makes possible authentic spiritual-ethical choices for transformation—healing, health, well-being, and a peaceful death” (p. xxiv). As the clinical nurse leader and the nursing staff in this situation engaged in caring practice that focused on the well-being of the patient, they simultaneously created a caring-healing environment that contributed to the well-being of the whole—the emotional atmosphere of the unit, the ability of the clinical nurse leader and staff nurses to practice caringly and competently, and the quality of care the staff were able to provide to other patients. The bureaucratic nature of the hospital included leadership and management systems that conferred power, authority, and control to the nurse manager, the clinical nurse leader, and the nursing staff in partnership with the vice president for nursing. The actions of the nursing administration, clinical nurse leader, and staff reflected values and beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors about the nursing care they would provide, how they would use technology, and how they would deal with human relationships. The ethical and spiritual choice making of the whole staff and the way they communicated their values both reflected and created a caring community in the workplace culture of the hospital unit.\nCritical thinking activities\nBased on this case study, consider the following questions.\n1. What caring behaviors prompted the nurse manager to assign the clinical nurse leader to engage in direct caring for Mrs. Smith? Describe the clinical nurse leader role established by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing in 2004.\n2. What issues (ethical, spiritual, legal, social-cultural, economic, and physical) from the structure of the theory of bureaucratic caring influenced this situation? Discuss end-of-life issues in relation to the theory.\n3. How did the nurse manager balance these issues? What considerations went into her decision making? Discuss the role and the value of the clinical nurse leader on nursing units. What is the difference between the nurse manager and the clinical nurse leader in terms of caring practice in complex hospital care settings? How does a clinical nurse leader fit into the theory of bureaucratic caring for implementation of a caring practice?\n4. What interrelationships are evident between persons in this environment—that is, how were the vice president for nursing, nurse manager, clinical nurse leader, staff, and patient connected in this situation? Compare and contrast the traditional nursing process with Turkel, Ray, and Kornblatt’s (2012) language of caring practice within the theory of bureaucratic caring\nLecture\nWhat is the difference between grand theory and middle-range theory?\n Grand theory is broader and provides an overall framework for structuring ideas. In description, Grand Theories are broad and complex in scope. They present a conceptual framework for identifying the key principles and concepts of the nursing practice. Even though they are known to provide intuitions useful for practice, they cannot be used for empirical testing.\nOn the other hand, middle-range theories are focused on a particular phenomenon or concept. They are limited in scope and deals with tangible and reasonably operative concepts. Their propositions and concepts are more specific to the nursing practice and they can be used for empirical testing.\nMiddle-range theory addresses more narrowly defined phenomena and can be used to suggest an intervention.\nRay’s Theory of Bureaucratic Caring\n \nMarilyn Anne Ray\nImproved patient safety, infection control, reduction in medication errors, and overall quality of care in complex bureaucratic health care systems cannot occur without knowledge and understanding of complex organizations, such as the political and economic systems, and spiritual-ethical caring, compassion and right action for all patients and professionals.”\n The theory was generated from qualitative research involving health professionals and patients in the hospital setting,\n The theory implies that there is a dialectical relationship (thesis, antithesis, synthesis) between the human (person & nurse) dimension of spiritual-ethical caring and the structural (nursing, environment) dimensions of the bureaucracy or organizational culture (technological, economic, political, legal and social). \n The Model is holographic, illuminating the holistic nature of caring & synthesis of the humanistic systems and technologic, economic, political, legal systems.\nMajor Concepts\n Caring: a complex, transcultural, relational process, grounded in an ethical, spiritual context. Caring is the relationship between charity and right action, between love as compassion in response to human suffering and need, and justice or fairness in terms of what ought to be done. Caring occurs within a culture or society, including personal culture, hospital organizational culture, or society and global culture (Ray, 1989; Ray in Coffman, 2006; 2010, 2013). \n Spiritual-Ethical Caring: Spirituality involves creativity and choice revealed in attachment, faith, hope, love, and community. The ethical imperatives of caring that join with the spiritual & relate to our moral obligation to others. Spiritual- ethical caring for nursing focuses on how the facilitation of choices for the good of others (caring, healing, well-being that should be accomplished or can be \n Educational: Formal and informal educational programs, use of audiovisual media to convey information, and other forms of teaching and sharing information are examples of educational factors related to the meaning of caring. \n Physical: Physical factors relate to the physical state of being including biological and mental patterns. Because the mind and body are interrelated, each pattern influences the other. \n Socio-cultural: Social-Cultural factors are ethnicity and family structures; intimacy with friends and family; communication; social interaction and support; understanding interrelationships, involvement, and structures of cultural groups, community and society. \n Legal: Legal factors relating to the meaning of caring include responsibility and accountability; rules and principles to guide behaviors, such as policies and procedures; informed consents; right to privacy; malpractice and liability issues; client, family, and professional rights; and the practice of defensive medicine and nursing.\n Technological: Technological factors include nonhuman resources, such as the use of machinery to maintain the physiological well-being of the patient, diagnostic tests, pharmaceutical agents, and the knowledge and skill needed to utilize these resources. Also included with technology are computer assisted practice and electronic documentation and social media. \n Economic: Economic factors relating to the meaning of caring include money, budget, insurance systems, limitations and guidelines imposed by managed care organizations and in general, allocation of scare resources including to maintain the economic viability of the organization. Caring as an interpersonal resource (love, communication, professional knowledge) should be considered, as well as goods, money and services. \n Political: Political factors and the governance & power structure within health care administration influence how nursing is viewed in health care and include patterns of communication and decisions in the organization; role and gender stratification among nurses, physicians, and administrators, union activities, including negotiation and confrontation; government and insurance company influences; uses of power, prestige, and privilege; and in general, competition for scarce human and material resources. \nMajor Assumptions\n Nursing/Caring\n Person/Cultural Being\n Health\n Environment/Culture of Organization\nNursing\n Nursing is holistic, transcultural & relational, spiritual, and ethical caring that seeks the good of self and others in complex community, organizational, and bureaucratic cultures. \n Dwelling with the nature of nursing reveals that the foundation of spiritual caring is love. Love calls forth a responsible ethical life that enables the expression of concrete actions of caring in the lives of nurses and for health & healing. \nPerson\n A person is a spiritual and cultural being. Persons are created by God, the Mystery of Being, a higher power and engages co-creatively in human organizational and transcultural relationships to find meaning and value. \nHealth\n Health is a pattern of meaning for individuals, families and communities. Beliefs and caring practices about health & illness are central features of culture. The social organization of health and illness determines how persons are recognized as sick or well, how health or illness is presented to health care professionals and the way health is interpreted by the individual. \nEnvironment\n Environment is a complex spiritual, ethical, ecological and cultural phenomenon. This conceptualization embodies knowledge & conscience about the beauty of life forms & symbolic systems or patterns of meaning.\n  Nursing practice in environments embodies the elements of the social structure and spiritual and ethical caring patterns of meaning. \nTheoretical Assertions\n Caring is the essential construct and consciousness of nursing.\n The meaning of caring is love and is highly differential depending on its context--structures (social-cultural, educational, political, economic. physical, technological and legal) as expressed in complex organizations. \n Caring is viewed as love and bureaucratic, given the extent to which its meaning can be understood in relation to science & the complex organizational structure. \nApplication to Practice/Education/Research\n Practice: Ray’s research has shown that nurses, patients and administrators value caring science, & the caring intentionality that is co-created in the nurse-patient or administrator relationship. \n By creating spiritual-ethical caring relationships, clinical nurses & administrators can transform the workplace into moral communities within the culture of humanistic, social, economic, political and legal values. \n Education: The theory is useful to nursing education because of its broad focus on caring & complexity science /s in nursing and the conceptualization of the health care system—used as an organizing framework for curricula.\n Universities and hospitals have incorporated Ray’s Model of Bureaucratic Caring in the framework for the baccalaureate nursing programs, and clinical environments to guide nursing evolution, practice, research, and administration.\n Research: Through Ray’s extensive experience with research, she has developed a phenomenological-hermeneutical approach (caring inquiry) that continues to guide her research and has been adopted by many researchers for the humanistic approach, using a lens of caring & caring science to study the human experience in health situations. \n Presenting Caring Inquiry Method August, 2013 at 32nd International Human Science Research Conference, Aalborg, Denmark",":slug18":"case-study-week-3-assignment-help",":category18":"Nursing homework help",":tag18":"Assignment help",":title19":"Discussion needed by Friday @ 5pm - asap",":excerpt19":"It is time to estimate your project’s budget.

They worshipped there some very old and famous deities of Radha and Krishna. Many people would come to see these deities and make donations for their worship.\nThe guru, however, was growing weak due to old age. He knew it was time to soon leave his body, but did not feel confident to hand over to his disciples the entire service of these deities.\nOne day a pilgrim donated a large ruby to the deities.\n\"I think it should be sold for money,\" one disciple declared. \"No, no!\" another cried. \"Radha should wear it.\"\nYet another gave his opinion, \"It would be far better if we cut it into many small rubies. Then we could make a beautiful necklace for Her.\"\nThe disagreement among the disciples carried on for so long that the brahmin felt that the deities would never get Their ruby. But, he did not interfere. He wanted his students to learn how to manage the ashram themselves. After a while he said, \"That's enough. Now each of you go to the woods. Bring back one stick, no more than an inch thick.\"\n  \nThe seven disciples stopped their quarrelling and set out to obey their guru's order.\nWhen they returned, the old brahmin took their sticks. He tied them all firmly together with a couple of lengths of rope. He then asked, \"Which one of you can break this bundle?\"\nThe seven young men each tried in turn, but even the strongest failed. \"It's not possible,\" they exclaimed.\nWatch,\" their guru said, cutting the rope with a knife. Taking each stick on its own, he very easily snapped it in two. \"I am getting very old. Soon I will die. You are like a bundle of sticks. If you try to help each other, cooperate and work together, you will be strong and serve me well. But if you become divided and fight, you will become weak like these separate sticks.\nAnd then, who will care for our Radha and Krishna deities?\" Realising their folly, the seven disciples agreed to set the ruby in a gold ring. That ring, they decided, was to decorate one of Krishna's fingers.\nFor this assignment consider the following questions: \nHinduism has often been called polytheistic. Yet it has also sometimes been called monotheistic. Why do you think both descriptions are used? Which do you think, is more appropriate? How does the bundle of sticks metaphor relate to the notion of dharma? \nYour writing should be typed in 12 point font, Times New Roman, and over 250 words in length, saved in a Word Document and uploaded.

The physician is in a position where he should integrate medical knowledge together with Mr. Gomez’s individual values, and cultural influences into his end-of-life care. The doctor should respect the autonomy of Mr. Gomez decision of not having dialysis and only perform tube feedings until he eventually passes away. Advance directives are legal document that must be respected by all healthcare professionals (O’Sullivan et.al 2016).\nDoes Mr. Gomez’s estranged wife have the authority to step in and ignore Mr. Gomez’s advanced directive. Explain your reasoning while providing evidence-based solutions in your conclusion\nMr. Gomez estranged wife has no authority to question any decisions made concerning his care because he has a healthcare proxy which is his daughter Elena. Based on the fact that this legal document exists, Mrs. Gomez, Elena’s mother cannot alter any decisions made by her daughter. Physicians and all healthcare professionals are mandated to follow and respect such documents and be advocates for the patient in the time of dilemma between family members. Mr. Gomez appointed his daughter as a proxy because he trusts that she will make sound decisions and respect his wishes in the event he cannot do so for himself. According to Lipkin in his article, he states that many patients avoid talking about healthcare proxy until it is brought up by their physicians. Physicians are encouraging families to have such conversation and designate a proxy that they trust and understand their wishes (Lipkin, 2016).\nGomez’s estranged wife has filed temporary order to ignore the advanced directive. If you were Elena, how would you handle this dilemma? What rights does Elena have that allow her to honor her father’s wishes?\nElena has the right to honor her father’s wishes because she is his healthcare proxy and she has full understanding of what her father wants. Even if she does not agree with her father’s decision of not wanting dialysis, she is mandated to respect those wishes and advocate for her father to get the exact care he wishes for. Also, if I was Elena, I will try to have a conversation with my mother and educate her more on advance directives and what they really mean in situations like this. She can also request counselling for both of them with the hospital ethical committee.\nWhat is the role of the ethics committee and how can they best support the client and his family?\nThe ethical committee is there to perform the following;\n-Educating healthcare professionals about ethical principles.\n-Consultation for decision making for health care professionals.\n-Consultation for decision making for family.\n-Developing organizational policies.\nThe ethic committee can support the client and his family by educating them about the situation and helping them make appropriate decisions.\nReferences\nLipkin K.

According to Hanson & Pitt, (2017), prior to obtaining consent for the proposed surgery, the surgeon must provide the following information about the surgery, “… the expected benefits, material risks and adverse effects, alternate treatments and the consequences of not having the surgery. Material risks include risks common to all surgery and risks specific for the proposed surgery, even if they are rare.” The situation in this case is known as the extension doctrine. The extension doctrine deals with the extenuating circumstance that when a patient originally consented for a specific procedure, further issues that are encountered, are best resolved in that current time. If the doctor during the time that the informed consent was being given, also explained any additional care, such as a biopsy, then the patient was fully aware and consented.  However, the extension doctrine does not hold true in cases where the patient has previously refused care. In this case, if the patient had previously refused care, then it is best for the surgeon to perform the colectomy only and have the patient consent again to any further care (University of Virgnia, n.d.).\nReferences:\nHanson, M., & Pitt, D.

In summary, the plot of this story begins with the protagonist who is Odyssey. Taking place in a time of war, particularly the Trojan war, Odyssey leaves his home in Ithaca to serve for ten years while leaving behind his wife. Over the years his wife was trying to be convinced by others that he was dead in attempt for them to take over her house.\n In the video, several critics unravel parts of the poem explaining some of the extraordinary adventures and unexpected events that he endured while trying to return home. The events that took place were described as suspenseful and emotional and other times could be funny. Furthermore, setting the tone and mood for the readers. The plot contained a theme that focused on the central idea of a solider who left for war and the spouse waiting home for his return. The irony of this poem is depicted in Odyssey’s adventures that he endured while returning to home because so many unexpected things were happening that caused his delay. This included storms and shipwrecks and even the introduction of other characters such as the cyclops. One of the speakers in the video talked about how Odyssey was known for his intellectual abilities and was able to escape this cyclops who trapped him in the cave after getting him drunk and driving a stake through his eye.\nWhat is believed to transpire when Odyssey returns home to his wife and it is described that he does not recognize Ithaca, sparked a strong connection in me as I too am a veteran who once returned home years after serving. From experience the return to home at first is awkward and takes time to adjust. It was mentioned that this could be seen in Odyssey as well as many soldiers who return home after a period. It was not mentioned that he might have had post traumatic disorder and it was not even known soldiers had that at the time this took place, but it is my assumption that because of the many unexpected events that Odyssey experienced it is likely that he might have had PTSD. “There have been accounts of the nature of combat stress in general (e.g., Blank, 1981, Hendin and Haas, 1984), but Homer's Iliad (Homer, 1975/ca. 800 B.C.E.) remains an outstanding narrative of toxic combat experiences that appear similar to those reported by Vietnam Veterans with severe, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)” (Shay, 1991).\nPolitical Influence:\nThe creation of the poem “The Iliad and The Odyssey” by Homer, is said to originate during the period of the “Golden Age of Greece”. Also known as the classical period or the Homeric or Heroic Period which is between 200 BCE-400 BCE.  According to Jacobus & Martin (2019), this was a period when literature was a spoken language in that no one thought to write it down but rather it was tradition of memorizing and reciting it (pg. 163). It is also believed to be a time that inspired many writers. While further researching this classical Era, it centered around a period when there was conflict and war. It was the influence of the ending of the Trojan war that inspired Homer to write. “The war began after the abduction of Queen Helen of Sparta by the Trojan prince Paris” (Trojan War, 2019). This sparked the famous Greek poet Homer to create one of the most epic and iconic poems of time. “The poem covers a mere 52 days of the Trojan war between a combined Greek super army and the Trojans, protected by the massive walls of their city, Troy in Anatolia” (Cartwright, 2017). Because of the creation of this poem in this period and what the people were going through it is believed that they could relate to Homer’s poem.\nReferences:\nCartwright, M. (2017, March 10). Iliad.

A person with high blood pressure may or may not display any symptoms therefore the person is at increased risk for a stroke, heart failure, and many other conditions that affect other organs in the body.  Ten years ago, normal blood pressure was considered to be systolic of 120 mm Hg and diastolic of 80 mm Hg. According to the American Heart Association, blood pressure readings are grouped in categories including the following;\nNormal Blood pressure: systolic less than 120 mm Hg and diastolic less than 80 mm Hg\nElevated blood pressure: systolic 120-129 mm Hg and diastolic less than 80 mm Hg\nHigh blood pressure (Hypertension Stage 1): Systolic 130-139 mm Hg and diastolic 80-89 mm Hg\nHigh Blood pressure (Hypertension Stage 2.): Systolic 140 MM Hg or higher and diastolic 90 mm hg or higher\nHypertensive Crisis:  Higher than 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic higher than 120 mm Hg\nThere are many drugs used alone or in adjunction to treat high blood pressure. There are five main classifications of drugs used in antihypertensive therapy which includes diuretics, ACE inhibitors, Angiotensin receptor blockers, Calcium channel blockers, and sympathetic nervous system drugs. Diuretics work by accelerating the rate of urine formation that result in the removal of sodium and water from the body. Some examples of diuretics are loop diuretics (furosemide), Potassium sparing diuretics (spirolactone), thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics (chlorothiazide), and Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide).  ACE inhibitors (vasotec, menopril, lisinopril) inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme, which is responsible for converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and induces aldosterone secretion by the adrenal glands. Aldosterone stimulates sodium and water reabsorption, which can raise blood pressure. This process is known as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The primary effects of ACE inhibitors are cardiovascular and renal. ACE inhibitors can be used alone or in combination for treatment in hypertension and heart failure. Angiotensin receptor (cozaar, teveten, diovan) blockers block the binding of angiotensin II to angiotensin I, therefore blocking vasoconstriction and the secretion of aldosterone, leading to vasodilation. Calcium channel blockers (Procardia,) work by causing smooth muscle relaxation by blocking the binding of calcium to its receptors, which thereby prevents contraction (Collins et al., 2019). Sympathetic Nervous system drugs are drugs that include beta adrenergic blockers (Lopressor, atenolol).  Beta blockers reduce blood pressure by blocking central and peripheral beta receptors, which results in decreased cardiac output and sympathetic outflow. Beta blockers that mostly bind to beta 1 receptors, are referred to as cardio selective because they do not significantly block beta 2 receptors (Arcangelo et al., 2017)\nThe goal of therapy should always be discussed with the patient.  A blood pressure within normal limits, or a pressure that is less than 140/90 mm Hg should be ideal. The consequences that can occur if the patient is not compliant with the medication regime in controlling blood pressure such as having a stroke, heart failure, kidney failure and etc. Important points that should be discussed during patient education on anti-hypertensive medications is to always   check blood pressure throughout the day and keep a log of the blood pressure to show to the provider on the next visit. Monitor for side effects of hypotension, especially postural hypotension, which is common among the geriatric population. Adverse effects like angioedema (for ex. Swelling of the tongue or lips) when taking ACE inhibitors, or signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, need to be reported immediately or patient is to go to the nearest Emergency room to get evaluated.  When taking diuretics, patients must remember to hydrate to keep from getting dehydrated. The patient also need to know that several different agents  may be tried before finding the one that best controls  his or her blood pressure with minimal or no side effects. Patient should also be educated on following a healthy diet, restrict sodium, quit smoking, maintain a healthy weight, and exercise regularly.

They are considered the first-line for treating hypertension. There are three main types of diuretics, which are thiazides, potassium-sparing diuretics, and loop diuretics. Thiazides act by inhibiting the absorption of sodium chloride in the distal convoluted tubule, loop diuretics work by selectively inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium chloride by acting on the sodium-potassium-chloride symporter in the loop of Henle, and potassium-sparing diuretics act on the collecting tubules to decrease reabsorption of sodium (Aronow, 2018).\nACE Inhibitors\n             The therapeutic action of ACE inhibitors is based on preventing the conversion of inactive angiotensin I to the active angiotensin II, which promotes the ACE inhibitors blood pressure lowing effect. They promote vasodilation, which prevents the narrowing of the blood vessels. Additionally, AC inhibitors also increase bradykinins and prostaglandins, which promotes reduction of blood pressure (Aronow, 2018).\nARBs\n         ARBs work by blocking angiotensin II from binding to its respective receptor, which, in turn, prevents it from promoting vasoconstriction and fluid retention. The receptors are found on the muscles surrounding the blood vessels. The effect of ARBs in blocking angiotensin II promotes vasodilation, which in turn reduces the pressure of the blood. The effect of ARBs also reduces the effort the heart has to put in pumping the blood (Aronow, 2018).\n\nCCBs\n         Calcium channel blockers lower the blood pressure by preventing the entrance of calcium into the vascular smooth muscles. The effect of CCBs promotes vasodilation by reducing the contractibility of the blood vessels. Two types of CCBs exist, those that act on the peripheral blood vessels and those that act on both the peripheral blood vessels and cardiac muscles. While both of them are effective in managing hypertension, the nondihydropyridines, which act on both the cardiac muscles and peripheral blood vessels, are also effective in treating cardiac arrhythmias. Both types can be used as monotherapies in managing hypertension (Aronow, 2018).\nSympathetic Nervous System Drugs\n          These drugs function by activating the sympathetic nervous system as hypertension has been linked to different modifications of the functions of the SNS. The main drugs that have been proven effective in activating the SNS and modifying its functions include ACE inhibitors, CCBs, diuretics, and alpha-blockers.\nPatient Education for Antihypertensive Medication\n         Patient education is important when prescribing or administering antihypertensive medication. Some of the considerations that patients should be educated on include the importance of adhering to their prescribed medication to promote its effectiveness in helping them control their blood pressure, and avoiding taking an extra dosage after forgetting to take their medication. Taking a higher dosage than the prescribed number of tablets can lower the blood pressure to very low point and increase the patient’s risk of complications or death. Other teaching points should incaalude the importance of talking to a physician before introducing another drug or supplement to the regimen to avoid drug-drug interactions and the need to report any adverse reactions that the patient might experience after using the drugs (Burnier & Egan, 2019). Taking these precautions seriously can reduce the risks of complications and promote effective management of hypertension.  \nReferences \nAronow, W. S. (2018). Antihypertensive drug therapy.

So I guess I'm just being a big baby, but I don't know what to do anymore and I'm about to lose my job for absenteeism.\n● My wife is suing me for full custody of my kids, and I can't stand the thought of her taking them. I would go crazy without the kids. They are my life. I'm thinking of taking them back to my home country secretly so that she can't get to them.\n●  I'm gay and 15 years old and my parents will totally disown me if they find out. I don't have any friends, anyone I could live with, and no way to support myself. I'm still in high school. I'm being bullied. My only friend is another gay kid, but he's out, and my parents have told me I have to stop seeing him.\n● I'm broke and have no medical insurance and can't afford antidepressants or therapy, and if I get treatment it'll show up on insurance as a preexisting condition!\"\n● \"I just had a baby a few weeks ago. The baby cries and I dread having to change his diaper or feed him. Sometimes I can't stop crying. My husband just makes it worse. I get so angry at him and say horrible things to him. I look like hell. I'm really ugly and I'm incontinent. My body is wrecked forever. I don't know what to do...I wish I never had a baby. \"\n● I just got to college and I do not know if I can make it. I always get it wrong in social situations and I have no friends that care about me. I think I want to go home.\n● I am 38 years old and my careers counseling group graded me as a “B” for job prospects. This has brought up all my old demons, especially suicidal thoughts.\n● My kids just left for college and my greatest role as mother has ended, I feel. To make things worse my husband will not talk about how depressed I am or about the kids leaving home.\n● I am 38 years old and pregnant for the first time. At this point I did not want to have children but my husband put so much pressure on me. I am sad all the time and have lost interest in my friends and any social activities.\n● I cannot believe I threw a drink in my colleagues face at the holiday party at 45 years old.

This literature review demonstrates a need for your proposed research study.\nPlease use the following outline of the Literature Review: LiteratureReviewOutline.docx\nPlease review the Exemplary Student Proposal found here: ExemplaryStudentResearchProposal.doc\nThe Literature Review should be 6-10 pages in length. For this section you will add on at least 5 more references to your Week 2 Reference List to make a total of at least 10 references. Remember that each reference you list in the Reference List must have at least one in-text citation in the body of the paper, and each in-text citation needs to have a corresponding reference in the Reference List. After you have at least 10 scholarly peer-reviewed journal articles, you may include books or chapters from books. The majority of your sources, however, must be peer-reviewed articles from professional journals. \nAs with the other sections of the Research Proposal, the Review of Literature will be submitted through Turnitin with the expectation that your Similarity Score will be no higher than 10-15%.\nYour paper will be evaluated on the following criteria:\nStudent's literature review supported the rationale for the proposed study by clearly reinforcing the identified gap in the literature. Literature review situated the proposed study in recent, peer reviewed literature from the counseling discipline and other related disciplines as appropriate. Literature review logically aligned with proposed methodology. Literature review was structured in a way that group related topics, themes, or studies together in a logical fashion.30 points. Writing is satisfactory for graduate-level writing expectations; the paper: uses clear and appropriate language; has no errors in spelling, grammar, and syntax; has good organization; follows APA documentation protocol.10 points.

Some states have laws that classify a person impaired to drive if an illegal substance or its metabolites are in the body. Marijuana, when it undergoes biotransformation, metabolizes into two different metabolites, Hydroxy-THC and Carboxy-THC. The first causes impairment while the second, although it does not cause impairment, stays in the body for an extended period of time. Consider how marijuana's biotransformation may vary depending on the individual and the varying ability of marijuana's metabolites to cause impairment. Do you think that laws that prosecute regardless of the type of metabolite are justified to prosecute for a driving while intoxicated (DWI)? Why, or why not?\n\nPlease include the name of the person or question to which you are replying in the subject line. For example, \"Tom's response to Susan's comment.\"\nALSO PLEASE REPLY TO ANOTHER STUDENTS COMMENT WITH A POSITIVE COMMENT RESPONSE BELOW \nADAM\nIn my opinion, the use of marijuana comes in two forms which are THC and CBD. From my understanding the excessive use of THC based marijuana is the one that causes impairment for me causing drowsiness and impaired judgement. However, I have not used CBD based marijuana, I understand that it has some medicinal use to treat pain, anxiety, depression, cancer, and other health issues. I believe that it is also true that marijuana can also have negative impacts to a person based on their body's ability to metabolize the substance. Marijuana is the same as any plant such as aloe vera, if your body is allergic or cannot metabolize the substance the effects can cause harm to the person. With scientific advancements in growing cannibis, this helped enhance our understanding of how the plant can be used and how it effects the body. I think that the law has yet to take this into full consdieration still demonizing the drug in the past. However, the future shows hope by making cannabis legal and studies proving that marijuana is not as harmful as it seems. I believe we must create more effective methods of assessing people who use cannabis and are \"under the influence\" and if they are truly impaired to perform activities such as work or driving. I have used marijuana for pain relief, relaxation, and to help promote sleep. I have never had any negative health impacts related to the use and believe there are far worst things your body can ingest that are truly poison whereas, marijuana is a plant grown from the earth.",":slug11":"advanced-toxicology-environmental-science-homework-help-assignment-help-4",":category11":"Environmental science homework help",":tag11":"Assignment help",":title12":"uassig Ha4 - cc",":excerpt12":"Unit outcomes addressed in this Assignment:\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of the relevance of economic concepts within t",":body12":"Unit outcomes addressed in this Assignment:\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of the relevance of economic concepts within the healthcare sector.\nExplain health care financing and economic principles as they apply to healthcare policymaking.\nDevelop an intervention of an objective to address the health problem.\n\nCourse Outcome assessed/addressed in this Assignment:\nHA415-6: Explain health care financing and economic principles as they apply to healthcare policymaking.\nInstructions\nThroughout this course you’ve had the opportunity to learn about economics and delve into Policy as it pertains to health care.

Times New Roman, double-spaced, size 12.\nCitations: Chicago Manual Style\n \nDescription: In this assignment, you are asked to analyze a selection of primary sources (historical documents) pertaining to the events of the First World War. In these sources, different authors with different backgrounds (nationality, class, gender, profession, and age) speak to you about their experiences and perceptions during World War I (1914-1918).\nObjective: Compare and contrast these primary sources, bringing them into a larger meaningful context. When comparing and contrasting, you could focus on these questions:\n\nHow do the experiences that soldiers and civilians made during WWI differ from one another; how are they similar?\nHow do you explain discernable differences or similarities?\n\nYour job is to analytically compare and contrast the sources, not to summarize them.\nMake sure you structure your essay coherently. Clearly outline in your introduction             the\nargument you intend to pursue in your paper. In your main body, use single paragraphs for single points (i.e. don’t discuss multiple ideas in one paragraph). In your conclusion, finally, sum up your main argument.\nYou do not have to use any sources other than the ones provided. You are welcome to refer to others, such as from the textbook or any other source that you find appropriate. This is not a research paper, however, and you will not get a higher mark simply for using additional sources.\nFor direct quotations, use quotation marks. For direct quotations and paraphrases, you must use a citation (footnote). For this assignment, we can use simplified footnotes, i.e. simply state the name of the author and title of the document. For page numbers just use the page number of THIS document (I realize this is somewhat arbitrary…).\nExample:\n\nNicholas II, Imperial Manifesto, p. 2.\n\nPut the simplified bibliography at the end of your essay. Use the same format as in your footnotes (name of author, source). For questions, send me an email or visit the WLC.\nPrimary Source 1: A monarch’s perspective\nRussian IMPERIAL MANIFESTO, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia\nAugust 2, 1914.\nWe NICHOLAS II, by the Grace of God, Emperor and Autocrat of all the Russias, Czar of Poland, Grand Duke of Finland, etc., etc., etc.\nProclaim to all OUR loyal subjects:\nFollowing her historical traditions, Russia, united in faith and blood with the Slav nations, has never regarded their fate with indifference. The unanimous fraternal sentiments of the Russian people for the Slavs have been aroused to special intensity in the past few days, when Austria-Hungary presented to Serbia demands which she foresaw would be unacceptable to a Sovereign State.\nHaving disregarded the conciliatory and peaceable reply of the Serbian Government, and having declined Russia's well-intentioned mediation, Austria hastened to launch an armed attack in a bombardment of unprotected Belgrad.\nCompelled, by the force of circumstances thus created, to adopt the necessary measures of precaution, WE  c o m m a n d e d  that the army and the navy be put on a war footing, but, at the same time, holding the blood and the treasure of Our subjects dear, We made every effort to obtain a peaceable issue of the negotiations that had been started.\nIn the midst of friendly communications, Austria's Ally, Germany, contrary to our trust in century-old relations of neighborliness, and paying no heed to OUR assurances that the measures We had adopted implied no hostile aims whatever, insisted upon their immediate abandonment, and, meeting with a rejection of this demand, suddenly declared war on Russia.\n WE have now to intercede not only for a related country, unjustly attacked, but also to safeguard the honor, dignity, and integrity of Russia, and her position among the Great Powers. WE firmly believe that all Our loyal subjects will rally self-sacrificingly and with one accord to the defense of the Russian soil.\nAt this hour of threatening danger, let domestic strife be forgotten. Let the union between the TSAR and HIS people be stronger than ever, and let Russia, rising like one man, repel the insolent assault of the enemy.\nWith a profound faith in the justice of OUR cause, and trusting humbly in Almighty Providence, We invoke prayerfully the Divine blessing for Holy Russia and our valiant troops.\nGiven at Saint Petersburg, on the second day of August, in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fourteen, and the twentieth year of OUR reign.\nIn the original the IMPERIAL MAJESTY has signed with his Own hand\n\"NICHOLAS\".\nPrimary Source 2: A soldier’s perspective\nErnst Jünger, Storm of Steel, 1914, German.\nWe had come from lecture halls, school desks and factory workbenches, and over the brief weeks of training, we had bonded together into one large and enthusiastic group. Grown up in an age of security, we shared a yearning for danger, for the experience of the extraordinary. We were enraptured by war. We had set out in a rain of flowers, in a drunken atmosphere of blood and roses. Surely the war had to supply us with what we wanted; the great, the overwhelming, the hallowed experience.\nPrimary Source 3: A writer’s perspective (from your textbook, p. 49)\nRoland Deregeles, “That Fabulous Day, 1914”\nIn \"After Fifty Years,\" Roland Doregeles (1886-1973), a distinguished French writer, recalled the mood in Paris at the outbreak of the war.\n\"It’s come! It’s posted at the district mayor’s office,\" a passerby shouted to me as he ran.\nI reached the Rue Drouot in one leap and shouldered through the mob that had already filled the courtyard to approach the fascinating white sheet pasted to the door. I read the message at a glance, then reread it slowly, word for word, to convince myself that it was true:\nTHE FIRST DAY OF MOBILIZATION WILL BE SUNDAY, AUGUST 2\nOnly three lines, written hastily by a hand that trembled. It was an announcement to a million and a half Frenchmen.\nThe people who had read it moved away, stunned, while others crowded in, but this silent numbness did not last. Suddenly a heroic wind lifted their heads. What? War, was it? Well, then, let’s go! Without any signal, the \"Marseillaise\" poured from thousands of throats, sheafs of flags appeared at windows, and howling processions rolled out on the boulevards. Each column brandished a placard: ALSACE VOLUNTEERS, JEWISH VOLUNTEERS, POLISH VOLUNTEERS. They hailed one another above the bravos of the crowd, and this human torrent, swelling at every corner, moved on to circle around the Place de la Concorde, before the statue of Strasbourg banked with flowers, then flowed toward the Place de la Republique, where mobs from Belleville and the Faubourg St. Antoine yelled themselves hoarse on the refrain from the great days, \"Aux armes, citoyens!\" (To arms, citizens!) But this time it was better than a song.\nTo gather the news for my paper, I ran around the city in every direction. At the Cours la Reine I saw the fabled cuirassiers [cavalry] in their horsetail plumes march by, and at the Rue La Fayette footsoldiers in battle garb with women throwing flowers and kisses to them. In a marshaling yard I saw guns being loaded, their long, thin barrels twined around with branches and laurel leaves, while troops in red breeches piled gaily into delivery vans they were scrawling with challenges and caricatures. Young and old, civilians and military men burned with the same excitement. It was like Brotherhood Day.\nDead tired but still exhilarated, I got back to L’Homme libre and burst into the office of Georges Clemenceau, our chief.ª\n\"What is Paris saying?\" he asked me.\n\"It’s singing, sir!\"\n\"Then everything will be all right. . . .\"\nHis old patriot’s heart was not wrong; no cloud marred that fabulous day. . . .\nLess than twenty-four hours later, seeing their old dreams of peace crumble [socialist workers] would stream out into the boulevards . . . [but] they would break into the \"Marseillaise,\" not the \"Internationale\"; they would cry, \"To Berlin!,\" not \"Down with war!\"\nWhat did they have to defend, these black nailed patriots? Not even a shack, an acre to till, indeed hardly a patch of ground reserved at the Pantin Cemetery; yet they would depart, like their rivals of yesterday, a heroic song on their lips and a flower in their guns. No more poor or rich, proletariats or bourgeois, right-wingers or militant leftists; there were only Frenchmen.\nBeginning the next day, thousands of men eager to fight would jostle one another outside recruiting offices, waiting to join up. Men who could have stayed home, with their wives and children or an imploring mama. But no. The word \"duty\" had meaning for them, and the word \"country\" had regained its splendor.\nI close my eyes, and they appear to me, those volunteers on the great day; then I see them again in the old kepi [military cap] or blue helmet, shouting, \"Here!\" when somebody called for men for a raid, or hurling themselves into an attack with fixed bayonets, and I wonder, and I question their bloody [ghosts].\nPrimary Source 4: A child’s perspective\nErnst Glaeser, The Class of 1902, German. (note the term gendarme = German policeman)\nA new front was created. It was held by the women, against a field of gendarmes and controllers. Every smuggled pound of butter, every sack of potatoes successfully spirited in the night was celebrated in their homes with the same enthusiasm as the victories of the armies two years before.\nTwo gendarmes were posted besides the threshing machine at the institute to check the quantities. They confiscated all the harvest. The farmer hated them as much as they had hated the French in 1914; even more, for they weren’t able to shoot them. The word enemy now meant the gendarmes… We hardly mentioned the war, all out talks was a lack of food. Out mothers were neared to us than our fathers.\nPrimary Source 5: Another soldier’s perspective\nErich Maria Remarque, German. All Quiet on the Western Front, 1917\n[During my home visit]. Formerly I lived in just the same way myself, but now I feel no contact here. They talk too much for me. They have worries, aims, desires that I cannot comprehend… they are different men here…\nHad we returned in 1916, out of the suffering and the strength of our experience we might have unleashed a storm. Now f we go back we will be weary, broke, burnt out, rootless and without hope. And men will not understand us - for the generation that grew up before us, though it has passed these years with us already had a home a calling; now it will return to its old occupations, and the we will be forgotten – and the generation that has grown up after us will be strange to us and push us aside. We will be superfluous even to ourselves, we will grow older, a few will adapt themselves, some others will merely submit, and most will be bewildered; the year will pass by and in the end, we shall fall into ruin.\nSource 6: A politician’s anti-war perspective\nRosa Luxemburg, German politician, 1916\nThis war's most important lesson for the policy of the proletariat is the unassailable fact that it cannot parrot the slogan Victory or Defeat, not in Germany or in France, not in England or in Russia. Only from the standpoint of imperialism does this slogan have any real content. For every Great Power it is identical to the question of gain or loss of political standing, of annexations, colonies, and military predominance. From the standpoint of class for the European proletariat as a whole the victory and defeat of any of the warring camps is equally disastrous.\nIt is war as such, no matter how it ends militarily, that signifies the greatest defeat for Europe's proletariat. It is only the overcoming of war and the speediest possible enforcement of peace by the international militancy of the proletariat that can bring victory to the workers' cause. And in reality this victory alone can simultaneously rescue Belgium as well as democracy in Europe.\nThe class-conscious proletariat cannot identify with any of the military camps in this war. Does it follow that proletarian policy ought to demand maintenance of the status quo, that we have no other action program beyond the wish that everything should be as it was before the war? But existing conditions have never been our ideal; they have never expressed the self-determination of peoples. Furthermore, the earlier conditions are no longer to be saved; they no longer exist, even if historic state borders continue to exist. Even before its results have been formally established, the war has already brought about immense confusion in power relationships, the reciprocal estimate of forces, of alliances, and conflicts. It has sharply revised the relations between states and of classes within society. So many old illusions and potencies have been destroyed, so many new forces and problems have been created that a return to the old Europe as it existed before August 4, 1914 is out of the question. [It is] as out of the question as a return to pre-revolutionary conditions even after a defeated revolution.\nProletarian policy knows no retreat; it can only struggle forward. It must always go beyond the existing and the newly created. In this sense alone, it is legitimate for the proletariat to confront both camps of imperialists in the world war with a policy of its own…\nThe world war today is demonstrably not only murder on a grand scale; it is also suicide of the working classes of Europe. The soldiers of socialism, the proletarians of England, France, Germany, Russia, and Belgium have for months been killing one another at the behest of capital. They are driving the cold steel of murder into each other's hearts. Locked in the embrace of death, they tumble into a common grave…\nThe madness will cease and the bloody demons of hell will vanish only when workers in Germany and France, England and Russia finally awake from their stupor, extend to each other a brotherly hand, and drown out the bestial chorus of imperialist war-mongers and the shrill cry of capitalist hyenas with labor's old and mighty battle cry: Proletarians of all lands, unite!",":slug13":"essay-history-homework-help-essay-20",":category13":"History homework help",":tag13":"essay",":title14":"Tarea #1 ETHIC N SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY - Assignment help",":excerpt14":"Cada estudiante traerá a clase un tema social debatible.

According to Nelson and Ruffalo (2017), there are four key elements to grant writing, “motivations, interests, partnerships, and actions. First, exploring and examine “why” helps pave the way for the grant writing process. Having motivation as an examiner on an issue or area when writing a grant can help impact a community long-term. Knowing what you want to do and why a grant is needed is essential. Secondly, when the grant writer and the associated partners have a settlement and awareness of the topic, the “what” the next step requires a literature search. Asking the question of what is the area of focus help fulfill the desires, the gap towards the interest in gathering information. Identifying the topic on what to write a grant about should start with an idea (p. 240). Thirdly, having supportive, qualified partners is important on the grant writing team who “recognizes a need for an initiative, desire to collaborate with other entities and commits to the project to completion” builds a more noble team to work with an aim towards achievement. Lastly, to move the idea forward, a grant writer distinguishes which category his topic falls in and how the community will benefit from the project and funding.\nWith Implementing these four steps 1. Why write grants (motivations)? 2. What is the area of focus? (interests) 3. Whom should be on the project? (partnerships)? 4. How to move forward? (actions)? According to Nelson and Ruffalo (2017), these steps can “facilitate potential projects from idea formation to grant writing and grant submission” (p. 238). \nA brief description of the grant proposal and an explanation of how to improve the grant proposals are not available due to the website's malfunction.\nReference\nNelson, D., & Ruffalo, L.

They report that they were referred to you by their primary care provider after seeking her advice because Katie’s teacher suggested that she may have ADHD. Katie’s parents reported that their PCP felt that she should be evaluated by psychiatry to determine whether or not she has this condition. \nThe parents give you a copy of a form titled “Conner’s Teacher Rating Scale-Revised”. This scale was filled out by Katie’s teacher and sent home to the parents so that they could share it with their family primary care provider. According to the scoring provided by her teacher, Katie is inattentive, easily distracted, forgets things she already learned, is poor in spelling, reading, and arithmetic. Her attention span is short, and she is noted to only pay attention to things she is interested in. The teacher opined that she lacks interest in school work and is easily distracted. Katie is also noted to start things but never finish them, and seldom follows through on instructions and fails to finish her school work. \nKatie’s parents actively deny that Katie has ADHD. “She would be running around like a wild person if she had ADHD” reports her mother. “She is never defiant or has temper outburst” adds her father.\n\nSUBJECTIVE\nKatie reports that she doesn’t know what the “big deal” is. She states that school is “OK”- her favorite subjects are “art” and “recess.” She states that she finds her other subjects boring, and sometimes hard because she feels “lost”. She admits that her mind does wander during class to things that she thinks of as more fun. “Sometimes” Katie reports “I will just be thinking about nothing and the teacher will call my name and I don’t know what they were talking about.” \nKatie reports that her home life is just fine. She reports that she loves her parents and that they are very good and kind to her. Denies any abuse, denies bullying at school. Offers no other concerns at this time. \n\nMENTAL STATUS EXAM\nThe client is an 8 year old Caucasian female who appears appropriately developed for her age. Her speech is clear, coherent, and logical. She is appropriately oriented to person, place, time, and event. She is dressed appropriately for the weather and time of year. She demonstrates no noteworthy mannerisms, gestures, or tics. Self-reported mood is euthymic. Affect is bright. Katie denies visual or auditory hallucinations, no delusional or paranoid thought processes readily appreciated. Attention and concentration are grossly intact based on Katie’s attending to the clinical interview and her ability to count backwards from 100 by serial 2’s and 5’s. Insight and judgment appear age appropriate. Katie denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation.\nDiagnosis: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, predominantly inattentive presentation\n Decision Point One\n\nBegin Ritalin (methylphenidate) chewable tablets 10 mg orally in the MORNING \nRESULTS OF DECISION POINT ONE\n·   Client returns to clinic in four weeks\n·   Katie’s parents report that they spoke with Katie’s teacher who notices that her symptoms are much better in the morning, which has resulted in improvement in her overall academic performance. However, by the afternoon, Katie is “staring off into space” and “daydreaming” again\n·   Katie’s parents are very concerned, however, because Katie reported that her “heart felt funny.” You obtain a pulse rate and find that Katie’s heart is beating about 130 beats per minute\nDecision Point Two\n\nChange to Ritalin LA 20 mg orally daily in the MORNING \nRESULTS OF DECISION POINT TWO\n·   Client returns to clinic in four weeks\n·   Katie’s academic performance is still improved, and the switch to the LA preparation is lasting Katie throughout the school day\n·   Katie’s reports of her heart feeling “funny” have gone away. Pulse was 92 during today’s office visit\nDecision Point Three\n\nMaintain current dose of Ritalin LA and reevaluate in 4 weeks\nGuidance to Student\n\nAt this point, Katie’s symptoms are well controlled (her attention is sustained throughout the school day) and her side effects have gone away following change to a long-acting preparation. There is no indication at this point that the dose should be increased as it is always advisable to use the lowest effective dose of stimulant medication. Katie’s heart rate is appropriate for an 8 year old girl and an EKG would not be indicated based on her heart rate.",":slug0":"case-study-nursing-homework-help-nursing-14",":category0":"Nursing homework help",":tag0":"nursing",":title1":"Nursing leadership #1 - nursing",":excerpt1":"1.

The assessment of ones QOL includes a persons subjective thoughts and feeling about their life situation at any point in the life span. As an individual ages their QOL mafy be compromised by their increased vulnerability to losses in health, functioning and social relationships. Studies show QOL is largely affected by aspects of a persons living environment. Research shows older adults who enter senior housing report a decrease in their QOL. However, two charteristics were associated with a bter QOL in senior housing: being of the female gender and having social scupport (Roberts & Adams, 2018). Thus, it is important for senior housing insitituation to make sure they have interventions in place to increase social support of their residents.\nThe baby boomer population with cause this age group to double in the next two decades. Consequently, the amount of senior housing needs to increase. This increase includes in inddepentant living and supportive care. Sutdies indicates the baby boomer population os looking for a more urban experience. This population is looking for certain amenities to aid in a comfortable living environment and provide opportunities for socializing. They want access to high-quality healthcare , connections to public transport, and accessible neighborhoods. The troubles facing the baby boomer population is future access to low-income housing (Sisson, 2017).\n\nWhen making decisions about a loved ones living environment it is important to acknowledge it is a aspect a person life that great impact their QOL. Research indicates residents living in senior living report and decrease in QOL. Taking those facts into consideration, living indepently as long as possible should be paramount in making decisions abut older adults living situation.\n\nResponse 2\n\n Your reply posts should be 100 to 150 words, with a minimum of one supporting reference included. \n Social capital represents the resources that are available to a population through social connections and relations with others. As older adults have access to social capital they are able to maintain productive, independent and fulfilling lives.\nSocial capital plays an important role in the growing aging population as it allows individuals to have quality of life. A number of implementations are necessary to rebuild the decline of social capital, things like senior housing, care development, assisted living facilities are a good place to start however, research shows that for a large number of older adults assisted living facilities can be financially inaccessible (Cannuscio et al. 2003).\n\nOne trend that is very common in the aging population is the large number of older adults who live alone in their homes. Statistics suggest that in 1979 it was estimated that 10 million older adults were living alone; by 1996 this number increased to 24.9 million. These numbers are very alarming because when older people live alone they become more vulnerable to aging concerns like isolation, financial insecurity and more (Cannuscio et al. 2003).\n\nThe involvement of older adults in church, or social clubs and other volunteer work helps maintain the social capital in society. Researchers suggest, based on different observations, that cohort of people who were born in the 1920s and even those born in the 1960s exhibited the same behavior when it came to being involved in community work and staying engaged (Cannuscio et al. 2003). This is valuable information as it helps understand that baby boomers will have that same impact in the community to live healthy lives and stay engaged with others (Sisson, 2017).\n\nThe literature agrees that assisted living facilities are a better option for senior housing. They offer a better sense of home to individuals where they can maintain a certain level of independence and socialize with their peers. In addition these types of settings offer a better environment for families to be around and interact with their loved ones (Cannuscio et al. 2003).\n\nDue to U.S zoning many assisted living facilities (ALF) are geographically isolated which defeats the purpose of community integration that older adults desperately need in their old age. Furthermore, due to federal regulations ALF may not be allowed to provide skilled nursing care to patients who are care-dependent (Cannuscio et al. 2003).\n\nClinicians should utilize the benefits of social capital by assessing the living situation of elderly people during clinical assessment. Providers should also encourage older adults to get engaged in different clubs or activities in their local community. There is a great need for sociologists and gerontologists to get more involved in long-term housing and encourage integration into local communities (Cannuscio et al. 2003).",":slug9":"respondo-quadro-uno-assignment-help",":category9":"Nursing homework help",":tag9":"Assignment help",":title10":"Tower quadro  2 -LTCCC - Assignment help",":excerpt10":"Response 1\n Your reply posts should be 100 to 150 words, with a minimum of one supporting reference included. \nThe ide",":body10":"Response 1\n Your reply posts should be 100 to 150 words, with a minimum of one supporting reference included. \nThe idea of cultural change in long-term care organizations is to revitalize the concept of care.  The goal is to make the care facilities more like being at home or on a vacation.  This concept made the healthcare more resident centered care. (Regis College Library Proxy: Login to Access Databases, n.d.)  When implementing reform to focus on RCC there were barriers on both the higher and lower income level facilities.  These culture change initiatives generally include a combination of the following types of factors: resident-directed activities, homelike atmosphere, close relationships between the staff and residents and their families, empowerment of staff to respond to resident needs and desires, collaborative decision making, and established processes for quality improvement.  (Press, n.d.) One of the largest barriers is staffing.  With inadequate staffing, there is not enough time to dedicate to each resident.  This includes when staff calls out of work on an already taxed shift.  When staff is taxed and overworked there are not enough resources to provide both quality and clinical care. (Regis College Library Proxy: Login to Access Databases, n.d.) Another barrier is the residence themselves.  It only takes one high acuity resident to take all the time from one facility member.  With low staffing, little resources, and high acuity residence there is no time to provide RCC.  To overcome the barriers in implementing RCC there have to be available resources.  Particular focus on utilizing mental health providers in roles that assist staff in training, communicating, problem-solving, and understanding resident values and perspectives may be helpful in organizations striving to provide care that is both resident-centered and high in quality.  (Regis College Library Proxy: Login to Access Databases, n.d.)Long term care facilities are usually driven by private enterprises.  This makes it difficult for all residents to be members.  More government regulations need to be put in place to provide aid for all aging adults to have adequate housing and care. With proper funding, the facilities would have the proper staffing and resources to provide RCC to all residence. \n\nResponse 2\n Your reply posts should be 100 to 150 words, with a minimum of one supporting reference included. \n \nThe general notion of cultural change in long-term care organizations especially nursing homes is a long-overdue change. As a wound ostomy and continence care nurse (WOCN), I constantly see elderly clients who are admitted to the hospital from nursing homes with multiple pressure ulcers and it makes me wonder if nursing homes are safe for our senior citizens. The only explanation for this type of trend is either there are not enough staff to provide care to the residents or lack of training.\n\nCultural change in long-term care organizations can be achieved with support from leaders in health care organizations and from the government. Health care reforms can lead to culture change in long-term care facilities. The affordable care act (ACA) of 2010 has helped to provide greater access to health care for our seniors and also to improve the quality of services delivered. According to Harris (2018), ACA can be improved by supporting efforts at the state level to expand Medicaid eligibility to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. This will ensure that ethical and racial disparities are currently in our long-term care facilities are minimized or eliminated.\nThere are multiple-barriers that can affect culture change in nursing homes. One barrier to be expected is push back from staff and some lower leadership. There are people that hate change and will do everything in their power to resist it.; But change is inevitable in life. Dr. Spencer made this know in his book “who moved my cheese”, and if we are willing to adapt to change, it will help us to continue to grow in every aspect of life. The biggest barrier to change will be financial barriers. To successfully implement change in long-term care facilities, the residents need to be willing to pay more. According to Chishom et al. (2018), the adoption of culture change in nursing homes requires facilities to have resources to invest in meaningful adoption of practices and Medicaid-reliant nursing homes may have difficulty implementing culture change practices. This means that for us to see more culture change in long-term facilities, there need to be health care reforms that provide more funding to these facilities for Medicaid recipients. Grabowski et al. (2014) reported that states experienced a greater culture change implementation when they paid a higher Medicaid per diem.\nAs a service provider for aging adults, I will focus on making changes with the resources I have available. The culture change will begin with the leadership team because they will lead the change. To prove that more funding is necessary, I will collaborate with other long term care leaders, who are willing to adapt to the culture change to propose and support policy changes in Medicare and Medicaid to increase funding. I will also work hard to provide evidence of quality improvement practices to health authorities. I will transform the facility into more of a person-centered system and solicit for more funding from the government to implement it.",":slug10":"tower-quadro-2-ltccc-assignment-help",":category10":"Nursing homework help",":tag10":"Assignment help",":title11":"Module 5 Discussion - Assignment help",":excerpt11":"Role of Ethics & Professional life\nWhat is the role of ethics in your work life?  Define and examine.\nSubmission Instru",":body11":"Role of Ethics & Professional life\nWhat is the role of ethics in your work life?  Define and examine.\nSubmission Instructions:\n\n\nYour initial post should be at least 200 words, formatted and cited in proper APA style with support from at least two (2) academic sources.

She had been suffering from emphysema for several years and had had frequent hospitalizations for respiratory problems. On the last hospital admission, her pneumonia quickly progressed to organ failure. Death appeared to be imminent, and she went in and out of consciousness, alone in her hospital room. The medical-surgical nursing staff and the nurse manager focused on making Mrs. Smith’s end-of-life period as comfortable as possible. Upon consultation with the vice president for nursing, the nurse manager and the unit staff nurses decided against moving Mrs. Smith to the palliative care unit, although considered more economical, because of the need to protect and nurture her because she was already experiencing signs and symptoms of the dying process. Nurses were prompted by an article they read on human caring as the “language of nursing practice” (Turkel, Ray, & Kornblatt, 2012) in their weekly caring practice meetings.\n\nThe nurse manager reorganized patient assignments. She felt that the newly assigned clinical nurse leader who was working between both the medical and surgical units could provide direct nurse caring and coordination at the point of care (Sherman, 2012). Over the next few hours, the clinical nurse leader and a staff member who had volunteered her assistance provided personal care for Mrs. Smith. The clinical nurse leader asked the nurse manager whether there was a possibility that Mrs. Smith had any close friends who could “be there” for her in her final moments. One friend was discovered and came to say goodbye to Mrs. Smith. With help from her team, the clinical nurse leader turned, bathed, and suctioned Mrs. Smith. She spoke quietly, prayed, and sang hymns softly in Mrs. Smith’s room, creating a peaceful environment that expressed compassion and a deep sense of caring for her. The nurse manager and nursing unit staff were calmed and their “hearts awakened” by the personal caring that the clinical nurse leader and the volunteer nurse provided. Mrs. Smith died with caring persons at her bedside, and all members of the unit staff felt comforted that she had not died alone.\n\nDavidson, Ray, and Turkel (2011) note that caring is complex, and caring science includes the art of practice, “an aesthetic which illuminates the beauty of the dynamic nurse-patient relationship, that makes possible authentic spiritual-ethical choices for transformation—healing, health, well-being, and a peaceful death” (p. xxiv). As the clinical nurse leader and the nursing staff in this situation engaged in caring practice that focused on the well-being of the patient, they simultaneously created a caring-healing environment that contributed to the well-being of the whole—the emotional atmosphere of the unit, the ability of the clinical nurse leader and staff nurses to practice caringly and competently, and the quality of care the staff were able to provide to other patients. The bureaucratic nature of the hospital included leadership and management systems that conferred power, authority, and control to the nurse manager, the clinical nurse leader, and the nursing staff in partnership with the vice president for nursing. The actions of the nursing administration, clinical nurse leader, and staff reflected values and beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors about the nursing care they would provide, how they would use technology, and how they would deal with human relationships. The ethical and spiritual choice making of the whole staff and the way they communicated their values both reflected and created a caring community in the workplace culture of the hospital unit.\n\nCritical thinking activities\n\nBased on this case study, consider the following questions.\n\n1. What caring behaviors prompted the nurse manager to assign the clinical nurse leader to engage in direct caring for Mrs. Smith? Describe the clinical nurse leader role established by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing in 2004.\n2. What issues (ethical, spiritual, legal, social-cultural, economic, and physical) from the structure of the theory of bureaucratic caring influenced this situation? Discuss end-of-life issues in relation to the theory.\n3. How did the nurse manager balance these issues? What considerations went into her decision making? Discuss the role and the value of the clinical nurse leader on nursing units. What is the difference between the nurse manager and the clinical nurse leader in terms of caring practice in complex hospital care settings? How does a clinical nurse leader fit into the theory of bureaucratic caring for implementation of a caring practice?\n4.

Managers understand their business operations and have established big data can improve business operations through better decision-making. Conventional business models have become increasingly unreliable as it has become difficult for them to make strategic decisions based on predictions made using algorithms. This explains why organizations such as Amazon have closed down most of their physical stores. Big data has paved the way for business executives to attain goals that they only imagined in the past (Janssen, van der Voort & Wahyudi, 2017). The big data trend has become increasingly popular and has led to smarter and improved predictions. The discussion offers a detailed evaluation of the article titled, Big Data, The Management Revolution.\nCritical Issues\nChallenges to the implementation of big data\nWhile big data stands to benefit businesses in a wide range of ways, it is difficult for organizations to attain the benefits if they fail to manage change accordingly. For big data to be successful within organizations, the management should develop clear goals and outline what a successful plan should look like. Big data works in cohesion with human reasoning and should be applied to establish opportunity and support strategic decisions. The second challenge that companies face is coming up with individuals to implement big data management (Janssen, van der Voort & Wahyudi, 2017). It follows that businesses need highly qualified individuals that can work with vast amounts of data to achieve business goals and objectives. \nIt follows that effective decision-making is a critical issue that affects businesses that apply big data. Businesses may fail to establish structures that allow flexible decision-making in light of big data application. The article asserts that big data calls for applying the latest technology, and businesses that fail at this do not succeed in its implementation (Janssen, van der Voort & Wahyudi, 2017). The final challenge that influences the application of big data is the company culture. This refers to the attitude that the organization holds towards big data. If the mood is negative, the implementation of big information is likely to fail. \nNew Decision-Making Model\nBusinesses face technical challenges in applying big data and a wide range of managerial challenges. The role of the senior executive management team becomes more complex (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). One of the essential facets of big data is the influence on how decisions are made. In instances where data is expensive and scarce, decision-making should be left to the experts as they are conversant with the business trends and patterns. This form of decision-making has been applied in organizations over the years and is termed intuition.\nWhen considering critical decisions, expensive experts are hired or senior individuals in the organization required to make the final verdict. Notably, crucial business choices are made by the highest-paid person’s opinion that is abbreviated as HiPPO (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). The article has demonstrated that companies in the present times rely excessively on intuition and experience instead of depending on the possibilities that are given by big data. Research has shown that most organizations have failed to implement big data to full capacity, which has continued to impact their competitiveness and business performance adversely. \nNew roles\nBusiness executives that are interested in making data transitions should plan for the strategy. They should start by preparing the implementation of two basic techniques (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). The first step is through the consideration of big data while making decisions on diverse issues. This means that they should reconsider the origin and application of big data. The second step asserts that the management should not allow the organization to be domineered by big data. \nWhen considering the challenges that can be addressed using big data, it is evident that domain expertise is imperative (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). Conventional domain experts are those that have gained competence in a given area. In other words, they have knowledge on the areas where the biggest challenges and opportunities can be found. Businesses should acknowledge that as significant data advances, the part that is played by domain experts shifts. An evaluation of the article clarifies that big data should be applied together with conventional approaches to achieve success. \nLessons Learnt \nAdvantages of Big Data \nExecutives have questioned the benefits of implementing big data in their organizations. It follows that there are organizations that have been skeptical regarding its application as they view it as an approach that disrupts companies’ operations (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). The first advantage of implementing big data is that it can be applied to process and make sense of high data volumes. It follows that businesses handle a high volume of data that can be used to make critical business decisions. It has emerged that decisions made using big data are better than those made relying on traditional methods. \nBusinesses that rely on big data benefit from a high velocity in data analysis, which increased the quality of decisions that executives make. It has been found that the business space has become increasingly competitive, and this improves the significance of real-time decision-making. Organizations need to be aware of business trends, and they can make changes that can result in profitability (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). As seen in the diverse format that company data is available in, the information world has become increasingly diverse. Accordingly, big data promotes the evaluation of the different types of data, and this facilitates decision-making. \nImproved Performance in airlines and businesses at large\nTime is believed to be one of the most important resources for companies in the present times. Minutes count as they can lead to profitability and losses in companies if not well utilized. Most digital companies such as Amazon rely on sales and use big data to study consumer behavior and predict future trends (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). The airline business relies on accurate information on flights to come up with critical decisions. Take off times and landing times are essential considerations for airline staff to minimize waiting times, driving operational costs. Airlines rely on big data to increase accuracy in calculating the time that is a critical factor in business operations. \nA prevalent practice used in airlines and the travel industry is the ETA (Expected Time of Arrival). It means that companies merely relied on estimates, resulting in increased costs and delays in decision-making. There was a shift in the airline sector as it began seeking decision support from PASSUR Aerospace to get accurate arrival times (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). It became clear that big data was transforming industries and business leaders continued investing heavily in the concept to realize improved business operations. \nThe need for talent management\nThere has been a growing demand for individuals that are skilled in data management. Consequently, there has been an increase in demand in the number of qualified individuals in data management and analysts. Most businesses operate in the online space as they realize the potential in this space (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). It can be noted that statistics is a valuable area of study that applies in big data but, it has been disregarded in the past. There are useful skills in statistics that apply to big data that should be considered in the present times when dealing with the management of enormous data volumes. \nCompanies should hire individuals experienced in big data management to support strategic decisions and improve business operations. On the other hand, businesses should improve employees’ competence in decision-making (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). Organizations should work towards ensuring all individuals understand big data and determine how it shapes business operations. This means that organizations should invest in skills that are associated with big data. \nBest Practices\nVisionary Leadership \nBig data does not move away from conventional best practices in business. Instead, it advocates for the application of effective practices specifically in leadership. It has been found that companies that have succeeded in big data have visionary leadership that questions methods and defines clear goals and objectives (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). Businesses should not apply big data simply because it is a trend. They should work towards understanding it and how it will benefit it. Additionally, business leaders should understand how the market works and think of creative ways to conduct business using big data. \nThe future demands leadership that will be flexible and will make decisions based on the market. In the present times, big data appears to be one of the best trends that will lead to increased business success and efficiency. Leaders' attitude towards big data will influence that of the followers and teams within the business. Consequently, leaders should have a positive attitude towards the implementation of big data. \nCompany culture \nThe successful implementation of big data is dependent on the culture applied by organizations. Companies and individuals in the organization should evaluate the knowledge they have about big data (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). A critical observation that has been made on companies is that they pretend to be more data-driven when they are not. Therefore, companies applying the practice should make sure that they understand what big data is before implementing it (Sun et al., 2018). Executives have often made decisions using traditional approaches and made it appears as if they used big data. \nOrganizations have been fast-moving towards big data owing to the fact that it has led to improved outcomes in decision-making (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). Companies that have cultivated a culture that combines data science with domain expertise have stood out in their respective sectors and set them apart from their competitors. As a result, the culture adopted by businesses impacts the successful implementation of big data. \nEmbracing Change \nOne of the most important lessons that I have learned from the article is that organizations should embrace change. This is because the introduction of big data has resulted in an increased demand for new technology (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). While the technology required to implement new data is expensive, it has been found that most of the software can be accessed by all users. Businesses should consider investing in new technology as it will improve their big data application, resulting in a performance improvement.\nBig data is likely to lead to the emergence of new roles that did not exist in the past. Concerning this, there has been an increase in demand for data analysts. The management should develop these skills in organizations through training the workforce and hiring the employees that have gained competence in these skills. The lessons learned from the article should be implemented in organizations applying big data in the present times. \nReferences\nJanssen, M., van der Voort, H., & Wahyudi, A. (2017).

Instead, it is Mary Lee Smith, one of your probationers, who is about to stand before the judge in a probation revocation hearing.\nWhen you and your husband split 10 years ago, you had two children and eventually had to declare bankruptcy and accept food stamps to be able to pay the rent. After seven years working as a secretary at the nearby state juvenile corrections center, receiving constant encouragement from Mrs. Jones, the superintendent, and taking advantage of a criminal justice scholarship program, you finished a degree in administration of justice and qualified for an entry-level position with the community resources division of the state department of corrections. You advanced as the system grew, and now, three years later, you are a probation supervisor in Judge Longworth's court.\nIn a way, Mary Lee is as much a victim as she is an offender. Married at seventeen, she quit high school and moved west with her husband who was in the army. By the time she was twenty, she had two children and was divorced. With babysitters to pay and skills that would command no more than minimum wage, Mary Lee turned to such income supplements as shoplifting, bad check writing, and occasionally prostitution. Her check-passing skills developed rapidly, and it was not long before she had amassed a series of convictions, not to mention several lesser offenses for petty larceny that were disposed of by the prosecutor's declaration of nolle prosequi. To date, Mary Lee has not served a day in prison. Judge Longworth has used admonition, restitution, suspended sentence, and probation to rehabilitate Mary Lee. However, Mary Lee's criminal conduct has persisted, as has her inability to stretch her food stamps, welfare payments, and part-time minimum-wage employment into a satisfactory existence for herself and her children. To complicate the matter, the welfare safety net that had helped keep Mary Lee and her children afloat would cease to exist for her within 24 months.\nJudge Longworth has called you into his chambers before the hearing. He read your violation report with interest. You pointed out Mary Lee's family obligations and the imminent possibility that the children would have to be placed in foster homes if she were confined. You also pointed out that she has been faithful in making restitution and that she maintains a steady church relationship and a good home environment for her children. Although your report is fair and accurate, you realize that the judge has sensed your misgivings and uncertainty concerning Mary Lee.\nJudge Longworth looks up from your report and comes directly to the point. \"Do you really believe this woman deserves to go back into the community? You certainly seem to have found some redeeming features in her conduct that I don't,\" he says. \"Unfortunately, it appears to me that the only way she is going to learn to respect other people's property is to be deprived of her own freedom. I think the community is getting pretty tired of this kind of repetitive criminal conduct.\" Judge Longworth looks to you expectantly for an answer.\nYou are on the spot. You know your answer might put Mary Lee in the penitentiary or give her another chance on probation. The judge will make up his own mind, but you know he values your opinion.\n\nShould Mary Lee be sent to prison or allowed to remain on probation?\nIs there anything else you can do as a probation officer to help Mary Lee make a more successful adjustment regarding living within the limits of the law?\nIs it enough for the courts or society to tell someone like Mary Lee not to commit petty larceny, or does our system have a moral duty to provide her with support services that could increase her chance of success?",":slug0":"probation-or-prison-law",":category0":"Law homework help",":tag0":"law",":title1":"organization change7th edition APA formatted paper - Leadership",":excerpt1":"CLA 1 Comprehensive Learning Assessment – CLO 1, CLO 2, CLO 3\nThis CLA1 requires that you define what are the systems ",":body1":"CLA 1 Comprehensive Learning Assessment – CLO 1, CLO 2, CLO 3\nThis CLA1 requires that you define what are the systems of resistance, and provide some understanding by answering the following questions: \n\nWhat symptoms of resistance to change have you experienced?

Before, companies used to collect information in written reports and extent files in order to develop algorithms and strategies that could help them understand the market and perform better. Companies not always had enough information to act timely and accordingly with customers’ demand. Today, although the intentions are the same, the tools available to organizations are far more advanced, leading to improved data-collecting techniques. The “Big-Data” era allows these same companies to make better decisions based on evidence-supported predictions, which leads to greater opportunities and competitive advantage. The big data movement makes marketing, advertising, and selling much more effective than it was a decade ago. It enables companies to gather all types of information that (1) are available to them, (2) can help them strategize better, and (3) lead to increasing sales if interpreted and analyzed right. Big data offers many benefits to the companies that decide to embrace it. It allows them to make better estimates of possible outcomes, increasing accuracy of transactions or events, reducing potential restraints that could end up in costly setbacks, and offering better solutions. Big data enables planning marketing strategies to be faster, easier, and more functional than ever before. Because of the enormous streams of data tied to people, activity, and locations, personalized marketing takes place increasing the chances of targeting more people. Of course, more data requires more responsibility. Although it may be perceived as otherwise, having a big pool of information is worthless if there is no human insight. Executives need to learn to effectively organize, analyze, and make sense of these data in a way that leads to better interpretation and greater knowledge. Leaders need to know how to understand the data available to them in order to decide what’s best for the company. Therefore, big data and great leadership are the main two factors that contribute to an organization’s success.\nWhich are the three most critical issues for this reading? Please explain why? Analyze and discuss in great detail.\n1 – Many executives base company’s important decisions in intuition and hunches. In today’s era, technology is not only a luxury but also a necessity. Technology gives us power to gather and collect data that is important for decision making. Experts’ opinions are important; nonetheless, they can be mistaken. On the other hand, data is reliable and unmistakable. Evidence will always overpower intuition. Traditional executives that don’t realize or maybe don’t trust the power of big data will have a disadvantage, and sadly they will not only be limiting their own potential but also hurting the well-being of the corporation. Although it’s true that in prior generations decisions were to be made based on expertise and experience, in today’s world data and information readily available play a bigger role. Unfortunately, executives that fail to realize this will be replaced.\n2 – Not every company is data-driven, and that is affecting their business. Although many businesses claim to be using big data to influence their decisions, studies show that not every company use data effectively and some of them don’t even rely on data at all. Sometimes companies (usually small) are reluctant to use data gathering technologies and justify this with its expensive cost. However, these technologies are becoming more and more economical and easier to obtain compared to when it first started. So, why are they not taking advantage of the opportunities that these tools can offer us? There are many reasons behind those decisions such as mindset, company culture, type of leadership, or poor management.\n3 – There is a downside to the usage of data. It’s true that executives should place important value on data collected to be able to draw conclusions and make better decisions that benefit the company. However, this shouldn’t prevent executives from using logical reasoning and applying their own knowledge and judgement. That is, executives shouldn’t rely alone on data, but in a combination of information collected and problem-solving skills. Data alone will not make a company successful; leaders with knowledge and skills are essential. The organization’s leadership should be able to analyze and interpret data to effectively exploit its full benefit.\nWhich are the three most relevant lessons learned for this reading? Please explain why? Analyze and discuss in great detail.\n1 – Companies that are data driven usually demonstrate better performance and greater success. Times are evolving, and technology is a big part of the evolution. Companies that decide to evolve and keep up with these changing times are usually the smartest ones. In our today’s world, most of the companies use technology and data to better focus their marketing and selling strategies. Companies who are not willingly ready to take advantage of the benefits these new advanced data-technologies usually fall behind. According to the reading, a research that was conducted by the MIT Center for Digital Business demonstrated that companies that embraced data are on average 5% more productive and 6% more profitable than their competitors.\n2 – The use of data leads to better predictions, which in turn leads to better decisions. Just like the example that the article described Amazon, among many other companies, uses data collected from online customers to influence their decisions. If a customer spends a great amount of time looking for an item, the system itself will automatically update the information about the type of items or products the customer is interested in. These are personalized data that the system collects and is unique to every single customer. Based on the data collected, then the system itself will make predictions about what type of items the consumer would like to look at. This big-data strategy will captivate the attention of the customers, present other potential purchases that could satisfy their needs, and therefore lead to increasing sales.\n3 – Data offers volume, velocity, and variety. Data not only enables companies to gather a large pool of information that is constantly updated, but it also offers them the possibility to access historical information at any point. Although information is gathered every minute, it never gets erased. This allows companies to design and project strategies based on history, patterns, and previous information that can be used to resolve problems and current situations. Another important characteristic of big data is that it collects information in real time, allowing users to manage and strategize action plans in order to attract more customers, reach a higher client-satisfaction, and beat competitors. The variety of data is eminent. We can accumulate large amounts of digital information in various devices and in different forms. We are able to use smartphones, computers, movement-detection cameras, and GPS devices. The information that we receive from these devices are useful in tracking location, detecting high demand products, ensuring safety, and targeting more potential customers.\nWhich are the most important best practices for this reading? Please explain why? Analyze and discuss in great detail.\nOne of the main things to do in order to utilize big data to our fullest advantage would be asking questions. The authors suggest that is important to ask ourselves one important question “What do we know?”. Data is solid evidence, and therefore it should be much more significant than our own’s perception about certain topics. High-performance management will always strive to find a reasonable balance between data-driven decisions and knowledge from experience. Making decisions only based off prior exposure to similar situations is risky. It’s crucial to state facts as we see them provided the data, and not as we think of them.\nAnother important thing to have in mind is to use technology to our advantage. Big data not only makes the collecting information easier, but it provides tools to help analyze it. Businesses that make good use of big data are the most successful ones. Take Amazon and Google for example. Both of them were born digitally and manage big data successfully. This gives them access to better marketing strategies, giving them a potential advantage over other business, and thus, turning themselves into two of the highest performing companies nowadays.",":slug12":"reply-to-discussion-4-analysis",":category12":"Business & Finance homework help",":tag12":"Analysis",":title13":"Human computer interface - computer",":excerpt13":"The HCI did not create its knowledge base from computer science only.

Just the opposite happens when the price of a good changes increases.

Receiving your BSN gives you more insight to nursing by learning about and understanding evidence-based practice and how to integrate it into action within their facility. The call for evidence-based quality improvement and healthcare transformation underscores the need for redesigning care that is effective, safe and efficient (Stevens, 2013).\nEvidence based practice strives to make all practices more standardized and deliver more positive outcomes examples being improved treatments, nursing skills, and safer care. This in turn will decrease healthcare costs for patients. This will also lead to reducing medical and care complications reducing the readmission rates . I personally will continue to search and integrate evidence into my practice by attending in-services within my facility and bring this back to my unit. I will also be assisting with the new nurses during their nurse residency at looking into new practices and evidence to back it that I will encourage others to use throughout our facility.\nSome of the barriers that could cause issues would be include time and lack of knowledge. As nurses time is precious, research can be time consuming and sometimes there is not enough evidence to support the change or resources. Research supports that when implementing EBP you must have leadership and supportive managers, a workplace culture that empowers nurses and reinforces EBP, and patient improvement outcomes are measured. Evidence based practice is important and facilities should encourage new practices with evidence to be introduced for improvement of their quality of care.\nKueny, A., Shever, L. L., Lehan Mackin, M., & Titler, M. G. (2015). Facilitating the implementation of evidence- based practice through contextual support and nursing leadership. Journal of healthcare leadership, 7, 29–39. https://doi.org/10.2147/JHL.S45077\n Stevens, K., (2013) \"The Impact of Evidence-Based Practice in Nursing and the Next Big Ideas\" OJIN: The Online Journal of Issues in Nursing Vol. 18, No. 2, Manuscript 4\n\nreply2\nEvidence-based practice allows nurses to review research in different areas, to gain knowledge and understanding of how well a diagnostic or treatment works (RIL, 2018). Evidence is used to also look at the risks and help determine a care plan, of which incorporates the patient. One way in which I can integrate evidence into the school setting, is to continue to reinforce health education into the students, their families, and the building staff. One way is by reminding everyone the importance of hand washing. Or in the case of my change proposal, maintain/control asthma by adherence to medication, amongst other things. Education is such a big part of school nursing, when it comes to the wellbeing of the children and their attendance, to keep learning active. As evident through research, using tools and programs like Building Bridges, Open airways for school, asthma-friendly schools initiatives, and collaborating with internal and external are excellent research practices to keep and encourage in the school setting. Challenges is always in getting the population to adhere, but through education, providing relevant information, with statistics, facts, improvement scores, and satisfaction rates is a great way to minimize the impact of change.\nReference\nEastern Illinois University. (2018, December 10).

You can use the pronoun “I” and trace your own reactions to what you read, but please remember to give your essay a coherent shape by remaining focused on your overall interpretation of the message and purpose of the story.\nReaction or response papers are usually assigned so that you will think carefully about what you’ve read, and determine how you feel about it. To know how you feel about it, you must first understand the story well. \n*\nThe first step of your task is to think about the following questions:\n· What is the story about? What message is it sending? In other words, can you identify the theme, or central idea, which the writer is trying to convey? To answer these questions, you should engage in technique of close reading while thinking about all the elements of fiction we’ve discussed in class. \nTo ground your discussion, avoid simple plot summary. Instead, formulate a few focused main points you would like to make. You might consider:\n• The tone of the narrator. (Remember that narrator of a story should be treated as a character in themself, and should not be confused with the author). Find evidence (in the narrator’s choice of words, and in both what they say and do not say) about the narrator’s underlying attitudes. What does the narrator feel about the characters and about their situation? How can you tell? When is the narrator being ironic? How can you tell?\n• The story’s concern with social justice or social critique. How is the story criticizing society? (Remember, it is easy to assume that the story is displaying the faults and failings of its characters. You could easily point out the mistakes the characters make. Try, instead, to see the bigger picture. What are the social and technological forces operating on the characters?).\n• The story’s feminism. (What are some signs in the story that men are even more foolish than women? Where do women in the story display hidden feelings that we might admire? What are the hints that women are more socially confined and constricted?). \n• Symbols. What are the major symbols in the story? What do these symbols tell us about what has value in life and what does not?\n• Conflicts. What are the characters’ inner conflicts. How can you tell?\n• Epiphanies. (What are the moments when characters realize a hidden truth about themselves, or we realized a hidden truth about them?)\nTry to provide an overall interpretation of the text and the author’s motivations for writing it. What is the message? What elements of modern life are put on display? What does this story tell you about China in particular?\nRemember to write your essay in the form of several paragraphs, unified by an overall interpretation you wish to discuss. Do not write it in the form of a list of answers to the possible topics/questions I have listed above. Each new paragraph should be indented. Please double space. Do not use headings. Give your response paper an interesting title that reveals your topic or highlights the story’s theme(s).\nRemember: do not plagiarize. Do not use anyone else’s work, whether from the internet, a classmate, or a former student.",":slug11":"report-report",":category11":"English homework help",":tag11":"report",":title12":"6552 - case study",":excerpt12":"Question\nFelicia Walker is a 14-year-old female who presents to your school-based teen clinic.

She is complaining of daily stomachaches for the past several weeks. She states that she has been complaining about them but everyone tells her it's just stress from moving and it will get better after she makes some friends. Felicia is new to your school this year and her record notes that she frequently misses her first class of the day. She lives with her aunt and uncle, who are her legal guardians. (Your clinic has private rooms that each person goes into; so there is no waiting room but they are assured privacy).\nYou ask her more information such as her living arrangements, how things were at her previous school, whether she likes this school (possible social issues contributing to her pain anxiety?\nDecision Point Two\nFelicia states that if she eats something it is better, but if she gets hungry it's worse. As you discuss her symptoms more, she relates that she is often late in the morning because she's been so tired recently. She states she's feeling better and doesn't want to miss her next class.\nShe decides to leave for her next class. Your next step is;\nask her to come back another time to discuss her symptoms and issues further with her since shes opening-up\nDecision Point Three\nFelicia comes back during her lunch break. You find out that she is also worried because she has not had her period since moving in with her aunt and uncle 3 months ago. She likes living with them but they are very religious and are at church three or four times a week.\nAs you talk with her more, you find she was removed from her mother's care due to drug use, and her mother's boyfriend was found to have drugs in the home. She says she's glad to be away from him because he's a \"pig.\nAsk Felicia why she called her mother's boyfriend a pig...Her reason is below...\nDecision Point Four\nShe says he's a pig because he smells like one. Upon further discussion, she tells you that he would come into her room at night and touch her. She is reluctant to go further with this conversation and starts crying.\nTo gain more information, you reflect on and clarify what she has told you, and you ask if this is one reason she is concerned about stomachaches and missed periods....\nDecision Point Five\nUpon additional questioning, Felicia says she is concerned that's why she hasn't gotten her period and just thinking about it makes her nauseous. She says she can't sleep at night because she thinks her aunt and uncle won't want her if they know. You do a urine pregnancy test and the result comes back positive. She states she doesn't want this baby in her. You find out that the mother's boyfriend is 40 years old, and Felicia feels safer now that she's in a different city than him.\n\n Looking at this case Scenario,\nbeing a mandated reporter and how the laws may allow a teen to make her own choices with regard to her reproductive health?

A diagram similar to the one used in Activities 9.6 and 9.7 would be useful to present resources and capabilities, but the diagram will only have value if it is used to support the analysis you present in the text.Once you have identified the relevant resources and capabilities, use one of the frameworks presented in Week 10 to appraise them (VRIO framework or value chain). Sections 4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3, are helpful in developing your appraisal skills, as is the discussion on the resources and capabilities appraisal of Starling Bank in ‘TMA 02 preparation – Part B’ tutorial.In framing your answers you may use the diagrams prepared in PowerPoint as provided in Sections 4.1 and 6.2, for both the frameworks. Once you have prepared a diagram in PowerPoint, copy and paste it as an image in your answer. You should discuss the contents of the diagram in the text.You can select one of the topics in Week 11 to develop your answer further but be sure that your choice is relevant to your argument. Choose the most relevant topic from: capabilities development (Section 1), dynamic capabilities (Section 2) or functional strategies that the company can adopt to enhance its competitive advantage (Section 3).",":slug14":"resources-and-capabilities-of-the-company-business",":category14":"Business & Finance homework help",":tag14":"business",":title15":"psychopharmacology - asap",":excerpt15":"Assignment: Assessing and Treating Patients With ADHD\nNot only do children and adults have different presentations for A",":body15":"Assignment: Assessing and Treating Patients With ADHD\nNot only do children and adults have different presentations for ADHD, but males and females may also have vastly different clinical presentations. Different people may also respond to medication therapies differently. For example, some ADHD medications may cause children to experience stomach pain, while others can be highly addictive for adults. In your role, as a psychiatric nurse practitioner, you must perform careful assessments and weigh the risks and benefits of medication therapies for patients across the life span.

They report that they were referred to you by their primary care provider after seeking her advice because Katie’s teacher suggested that she may have ADHD. Katie’s parents reported that their PCP felt that she should be evaluated by psychiatry to determine whether or not she has this condition.\nThe parents give you a copy of a form titled “Conner’s Teacher Rating Scale-Revised”. This scale was filled out by Katie’s teacher and sent home to the parents so that they could share it with their family primary care provider. According to the scoring provided by her teacher, Katie is inattentive, easily distracted, forgets things she already learned, is poor in spelling, reading, and arithmetic. Her attention span is short, and she is noted to only pay attention to things she is interested in. The teacher opined that she lacks interest in school work and is easily distracted. Katie is also noted to start things but never finish them, and seldom follows through on instructions, and fails to finish her school work.\nKatie’s parents actively deny that Katie has ADHD. “She would be running around like a wild person if she had ADHD” reports her mother. “She is never defiant or has temper outbursts” adds her father.\nSUBJECTIVE\nKatie reports that she doesn’t know what the “big deal” is. She states that school is “OK”- her favorite subjects are “art” and “recess.” She states that she finds her other subjects boring, and sometimes hard because she feels “lost”. She admits that her mind does wander during class to things that she thinks of as more fun. “Sometimes” Katie reports “I will just be thinking about nothing and the teacher will call my name and I don’t know what they were talking about.”\nKatie reports that her home life is just fine. She reports that she loves her parents and that they are very good and kind to her. Denies any abuse, denies bullying at school. Offers no other concerns at this time.\nMENTAL STATUS EXAM\nThe client is an 8-year-old Caucasian female who appears appropriately developed for her age. Her speech is clear, coherent, and logical. She is appropriately oriented to person, place, time, and event. She has dressed appropriately for the weather and time of year. She demonstrates no noteworthy mannerisms, gestures, or tics. The self-reported mood is euthymic. The effect is bright. Katie denies visual or auditory hallucinations, no delusional or paranoid thought processes readily appreciated. Attention and concentration are grossly intact based on Katie’s attendance at the clinical interview and her ability to count backward from 100 by serial 2’s and 5’s. Insight and judgment appear age-appropriate. Katie denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation.\nDiagnosis: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, predominantly inattentive presentation\nRESOURCES\n§ Conners, C. K., Sitarenios, G., Parker, J.

They all energized his young, innovative brain and would help fuel the inventive virtuoso to come. \nFebruary's highlighted writer is the unbelievable Science fiction/Dream essayist Ray Bradbury who formed profoundly applauded works like in the summary of Fahrenheit 451, Something Fiendish This Way Comes, The Martian Annals, just as many short stories. \n2. Bradbury bombed his 11th grade language capability test \nRay Bradbury bombed his language capability test in 11th grade and needed to take a therapeutic syntax class his senior year. This episode says a lot of Bradbury's inclinations and ability. He was an extremely committed young fellow who composed early and frequently, yet one who didn't really zero in on his school smarts. After Ray's secondary school graduation function he understood, \"there was a huge level of nothing hanging tight for me.\" Ray realized it is dependent upon him to make his fantasy about being an essayist a reality thus he set out with another intensity. \n3. Ray Bradbury never had a proper instruction \nAs a youngster from a working class family during the incredible melancholy, Ray didn't have the alternative to pay for college. Rather than a professional education, Bradbury went to the library three days every week for a very long time. Bradbury attempted a wide range of unspecialized temp jobs after secondary school, yet chose working at a magazine kiosk. This was a work he would hold for the following four years since it gave him an opportunity to directly in the unfilled long stretches of early in the day and mid-evening. This procedure would pay off. Before the finish of his first summer after secondary school Bradbury would have just finished fifteen drafts. \n4. A disloyalty from a companion nearly destroyed his vocation \nIn 1946 Ray Bradbury was offered an amazing open door. Martha Foley needed to incorporate Ray's short story in her forthcoming compilation. This element could sling Bradbury's vocation into additional achievement. Notwithstanding, Bradbury was not even mindful the offer had been made. The very man that Ray had made a trip to Mexico with, Sea shore, had blocked Martha's message and reacted, professing to be Ray and declining the offer. This was by all account not the only mail that Sea shore had messed with. Sea shore, maybe in an attack of innovative envy, had been catching calls, letters, and wires as they came into the apartment workplaces where the two of them held studio spaces. Bradbury was warned by a shared companion in the business, who Martha cautioned after Bradbury declined her proposal of distribution. Bradbury went up against Sea shore who admitted to everything. \n5. Fahrenheit 451 was written in the storm cellar of a library \nAt the time Bradbury's most popular work was composed he and Maggie had two little girls. Too poor to even consider bearing the cost of an office, and it being too noisy to even consider working in his home, Bradbury by and by went to the library to discover an answer. He heard a mechanical clicking and found that in the storm cellar of the UCLA library you could lease a typewriter for 10¢ each half hour. It was here, encompassing by books, that Bradbury kept in touch with quite possibly the most powerful neutralizes control for $9.80.",":slug3":"5-intriguing-realities-about-beam-bradbury-creator-of-fahrenheit-451-essay",":category3":"Literature homework help",":tag3":"essay",":title4":"Intermediate accounting - assignments",":excerpt4":"I need someone to take my intermediate accounting course and COMPLETE ALL ASSIGNMENTS with the exception of the discussi",":body4":"I need someone to take my intermediate accounting course and COMPLETE ALL ASSIGNMENTS with the exception of the discussion board ALL ASSIGNMENTS POSTED UNDER THE ASSIGNMENT TAB",":slug4":"intermediate-accounting-assignments",":category4":"Business & Finance homework help",":tag4":"assignments",":title5":"Journal Entry (Reflection): Business & Finance homework help - Reflection 3",":excerpt5":"Journal Entry (week 4)\n\nPlease submit your journal entry or short essay for this week here. You should include your th",":body5":"Journal Entry (week 4)\n\nPlease submit your journal entry or short essay for this week here. You should include your thoughts and reflections on this week's assigned readings, lectures, additional material, personal experiences, ideas regarding your final project, and concerns.

Clinical presentation includes high fever (102.7 F), hemoptysis, gastrointestinal symptoms, and fatigue. He displayed some significant improvement on the third day, including decreased oxygen requirements, a normal heart rate, and a decreasing HCO3 range after receiving empiric antibiotics such as a daily dose of one-gram IV of ceftriaxone and 500 mg azithromycin IV. However, the patient is not tolerating a diet, coupled with complaints of nausea and vomiting. Moreover, the patient is allergic to penicillin and resistant to erythromycin and tetracycline, evidenced by a minimum inhibitory concentration (MCI) of >16. The goal of the treatment is to inhibit the growth of streptococcus pneumoniae, stabilize the patient’s arterial blood gases, ensure optimal general health, and eliminate feelings of nausea and vomiting.\nTreatment Regimen\nThe treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) should be based on the patient’s characteristics. For instance, the patient is an older adult male with COPD and an allergic reaction to penicillin. The preferred antibiotics for the treatment of CAP are doxycycline, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones (Bidell, Pai, & Lodise, 2020). However, the MCI of > 16 for erythromycin and tetracycline indicates resistance to some macrolides. Azithromycin 500 mg IV is the first-line treatment, as recommended by the CDC and its success on the patient in improving the symptoms (Mandell et al., 2017). Though, considering the patient’s COPD and use of antimicrobials, I would recommend the following, in line with CDC recommendations:\n\nlevofloxacin (750 mg/day) and monitor for adverse effects or\namoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg [twice daily).\n\nUsing bronchodilators for COPD together with azithromycin could increase the risk of tachycardia, considering that this patient had a fast heart rate on admission (Noor et al., 2019). Bronchodilators include Albuterol and Salmeterol (Rosenthal & Burchum, 2021). Also, Level I evidence suggest that the treatment should be maintained for five days. Discontinue penicillin due to its rash effect on the patient. Furthermore, Azithromycin may excercabate nausea and vomiting in patients with gastrointestinal issues.  \nPatient Education\n The caregiver should recommend pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine for the at-risk patient. Secondly, advice the patient to maintain the medication for at least five days and report any adverse effects associated with levofloxacin (nausea and vomiting) or amoxicillin-clavulanate (mild diarrhea, rash, and vomiting). Levofloxacin tablets can be taken with or without food, but avoid dairy products two hours prior as it hinders the effectiveness of the drug (Noor et al., 2019).\nReferences\nBidell, M. R., Pai, M.

She is up to date on yearly mammograms. She has a history of hypertension. She complains of hot\nflushing, night sweats, and genitourinary symptoms. She had felt well until one month ago, and she presented to her gynecologist for her annual gynecological examination and discussed her symptoms. She has a history of ASCUS about\nfive years ago on her pap. Other than that, Pap smears have been regular. Home medications are Norvasc, 10 mg every day, and HCTZ 25 mg every day. Her blood pressure today is 150/90. She has regular monthly menstrual cycles. Her\nlast menstrual period (LMP) was one month ago.\n          Menopause is the constant cessation of menstruation after the loss of ovarian follicular activity. In the United States, the median age at the beginning of menopause is 51 years but may vary significantly from 40 to 58 years. Symptoms\nof vasomotor instability may include hot flashes, night sweats, sleep, and mood disorders and indicate early estrogen loss (DiPiro et al., 2016). In addition to menopausal symptoms, estrogen production loss leads to critical metabolic\nchanges, including effects on body composition, cognition (central nervous effect), lipids, vascular function, and bone metabolism (Rosenthal & Burchum, 2016). The menopause transition is associated with a significant increase in central\nabdominal fat leading to an average weight gain during the five lb. menopause transition (DiPiro et al., 2016).  Menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT) has three primary benefits: suppression of vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes, night\nsweats), prevention of urogenital atrophy, and prevention of osteoporosis and related fractures (Rosenthal & Burchum, 2016). In the study of Kim et al. (2020), their findings suggest that underlying disease and timing of initiation should be\ncarefully considered before starting therapy in postmenopausal women\nTreatment\n            As with any drug, prescribing decisions require weighing the benefits and risks. The patient has updated mammograms, and pap smears have been normal. I would start the patient to start on MHT. The candidate patient for MHT\nmust be informed of known risks potential for endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and cardiovascular thromboembolic events) (Rosenthal & Burchum, 2018). I would consider a combination MHT of Estradiol (E) +\ndrospirenone (DRSP). A study by Park et al. (2017) highlights that greater than 85% of Korean patients experienced improved menopausal symptoms on drospirenone 2mg/estradiol 1 mg MHT.  The results from their surveillance study\nconfirm the efficacy and safety of DRSP 2 mg/E2 1 mg tablet. Continuous combined MHT is more acceptable than traditional cyclic therapy (DiPiro et al., 2016).\n Patient Education\n As a provider, it is essential to educate patients.  It may be beneficial to increase the dosage of HCTZ if the blood pressure remains elevated. Thiazides promote tubular reabsorption of calcium and decrease osteoporosis risk in\npostmenopausal women.  Patients should not take contraindications of MHT with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolus, or conditions such as stroke or myocardial infarction (MI) that occurred secondary\nto a thromboembolic event. For women who choose to taper slowly, again, there are two basic options, referred to as \"dose tapering\" and \"day tapering.\" Dosing is done every day with dose tapering, but the daily dose's size is gradually\nreduced. If severe symptoms recur following a dose reduction, further reductions should be postponed until symptoms improve. As the daily dose is reduced, the daily dose remains unchanged, but the number of days between doses\nincreases gradually, starting with a dose every two days, then every three days, and so on. Whichever method is used, whether the dose is decreasing or daily, only the estrogen dose must be reduced (Rosenthal & Burchum, 2018).\n           The benefits of short-term therapy (less than five years) to treat menopausal symptoms. To keep risk as low as possible, MHT should be used in the lowest dosage and for the shortest time needed to accomplish treatment goals\n(Rosenthal & Burchum, 2018). \n                                                                                                                                        References\nDiPiro, J., Talbert, R., Yee, G., Matzke, G., Wells, B., & Posey, M.

What are some other important details about this person, group of people, institution, or idea?\n5. Again, who are you commemorating and why?\n\nExample Answers:\n1. What is story that will help you introduce this person, group of people, institution, or idea without giving the name of this person, group of people, institution, or idea?  Tell a short story that paints a picture for everyone about this person.\n\nExample:\n           “There once was young boy who grew up during hard times in the 1940’s. He was born to wonderful mother who loved him so. He was also born to a father who cared for him, but in his own special way. His father was well known alcoholic. His mother was the second wife of this man. The young boy grew up without much. He helped worked the fields and his dad made some money as a fireman, but drank it all up.\n           As the boy grew older, his family grew poorer. In fact, they lost their home to the bank. They had to cut trees down off the land and build a log cabin to live and have shelter. The boy would get beat by his dad and watch his mom and sisters get knocked around a lot. He would take the beatings and tried to protect the women of the house. This became more and more as each day passed. One day when the boy turned seventeen, he ran away from home. He was so tired of getting beat all the time. The circus had come to town in Hattiesburg; and when they left, he left with them. He had become a really large man and worked on the crew that put up the big tent for the circus- the big top. He worked only for about a year, but learned much.\n           He later went on to land a job with the Mississippi Department of Transportation working on the roads inMississippi. He was big man by this time. He was probably six foot four. He had kind, dreamy blue eyes, and was shy around most people. As he was working on the roads in a little town called Poplarville, he met a beautiful woman and fell in love. Her family owned some property in the middle of town and they married.\n           He went on to have one son, serve in the military, and become a pillar of the Poplarville Community. He became well-known as the man who would give his shirt off his back to help a fellow citizen. He was caring, gentle, and honest.”\n2. Who or what are you talking about?  Be sure to tell who you are commemorating.\n\nExample:\n           “Today, I am commemorating my grandfather, Pete Finnemore Hatten.”\n3. Why are you commemorating this person, group of people, institution, or idea?\nExample:\n           “ A man to whom many would never call a stranger and always call a friend. He came from humble means, but went on in life to become my hero. Even though he has now passed on, he leaves a mark on the hearts of all who knew him. He would visit the sick and poor. He would go around to the restaurants and anything they were going to throw out, he would bring to those who needed it. He knew everyone, and everyone knew him. He would go out of his way to help someone, even if he had less than the person he was helping.  \n           I remember so many times when he helped others. Even after his death, he donated his car (an antique in pristine condition) to a man he knew that did not have a car. He knew that man needed one to get to work and that the man walked to work everyday. He donated money anonymously to the church to build a new steeple or to for repairs. My grandfather was not wealthy, he just used his money wisely.”\n4. What are some other important details about this person, group of people, institution, or idea?\nExample:\n          “As I mentioned earlier, my grandfather was drafted into the military during World War II. He lived through the depression. He went on to graduate fromPearl River Community College. He served as an alderman in Poplarville for several terms. He literally knew everyone. He did not care if you poor or rich, black or white, or old or young. He knew you and he knew what needs you may have. I remember him collecting clothes from local stores, along with one of his friend’s Dave. They would give it away to people they knew needed the clothes. Amazingly, my grandfather never took any for himself. He always wore coveralls or the same plaid shirts with work pants.\n        After my grandfather and grandmother had their first and only child, she moved him into a separate bedroom as she said she could not have another child. She said it almost killed her. My grandfather was such a good man to his wife. He would sit for hours in town in the heat while his wife ran her errands in town. He did most of cleaning, cooking, and sewing for his family. He also was a wood and metal tradesman, where he worked very hard to provide for his family. He and my grandmother sacrificed a lot to send their son to college. My grandfather could repair anything. I don’t think there was anything my grandfather couldn’t fix or couldn’t do. He was simply amazing.”\n5. Again, who are you commemorating and why?\nExample:\n           “I am commemorating my grandfather tonight. He was a husband, who loved his wife unconditionally. He was a father who sacrificed for much for his son. He was a pillar in the community that everyone could count on for help.  He was a man who never met a stranger and was kind to so many. He left a legacy for his grandchildren to remember- one of love, kindness, honesty, and perseverance. My grandfather, Pete Finnemore Hatten, was simply an amazing man.

The newfound prosperity allowed sociopolitical movements to gain momentum. During this era, the two superpowers continued to struggle as the Soviet Union continued its attempt to influence world leaders to adopt Communism, while the United States fought back by promoting capitalism to these leaders.\nLeaders in the Americas faced new gender, ethnic, and other social movements. The struggle for democracy during the post-Cold War inspired many people in the United States to stand up for their individual rights and for equality in the political, social, and economic scenes. The uneven distribution of rewards from the economic rise increased the civil unrest, which also fueled a civil rights revolution in the United States. This quest for equality also echoed throughout the world and caused high levels of rural-urban migration.\nThis week, you will read about one of the most transformational times in the history of the Americas. You will also review the underlying factors leading to the civil unrest in the Americas, as well as one of the most tense moments in the post-Cold War era as nations fought to find their place in the world.\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this week, you should be able to:\n\nCorrelate the importance of postwar industrialization and urbanization with factors in revolutionary and civil rights movements in the United States and Latin America\nEvaluate the changes experienced and witnessed during and after the Cold War\nIdentify issues, events, and policies that have been created as a result of the Cold War\n\nLearning Resources\nRequired Readings\nLukacs, J.

During this time, nations rode an economic roller coaster leading to the stratification of social and economic inequality. The widening socioeconomic gap between the status of people within these nations then led to civil unrest and the call for civil rights, equality, and respect. The growth in industrialization between these two continents resulted in high levels of great rural and urban sprawl.\nAs poverty increased in the Americas, groups that had historically been subordinate groups made their voices heard in their cry to escape the thumb hold of dominant groups. This uprising did not resonate well with dominant groups. During this time, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. led the civil rights movement and fought for racial equality.\nIn these troubled times, the people of South America were facing similar struggles. They also witnessed battles between Socialist/Communist leaders, military leaders, and others that wanted to see democracy.\nIn this Discussion, you will explore the struggles of the people of both North and South America. You will share your thoughts as you discover which of these nations' struggles were similar and which were different.\nTo prepare for this Discussion:\n\nReview the Lukacs, Nimtz, and Gould readings in our Learning Resources.\nReview the L'Unita interview with Fidel Castro and Salvador Allende's speech from this week's Learning Resources.\nWith this week's reading in mind, consider the various nationalist struggles for independence that followed in the post - World War II era.\nRecall the challenges that the new leaders faced as civil rights movements increased.\nReflect upon poverty-stricken nations and what they might have endured in their quest for social change.\nCorrelate postwar industrialization, revolutionary, and civil rights movements in both North and South America.\nConsider the struggles faced in North and South America. How were they different? Similar?\n\nWith these thoughts in mind:\nBy Day 3\nPost by Day 3 an analysis (3–4 paragraphs) comparing revolutionary and civil rights movements in the United States and Latin America and the extent to which the changes desired by the people were or were not achieved and why.\n\nBe sure to support your ideas by properly citing at least one of week's Learning Resources, in APA format, within your initial post.

During this time, nations saw a rise in globalization paralleled by an explosion of consumerism. These changes brought about power struggles, which ensued as nations clawed their way to the top and into superpower roles.\nWith these changes came increased tension between the democratic and communist nations. In the aftermath of World War II, the fear of a new war weighed heavily on the people of the Americas. This weight soon caused political, economic, and social division within these nations.\nIn this assignment, you will review, reflect upon, and share your thoughts about the changes people experienced and witnessed during the first decades of the Cold War.\nTo prepare for this assignment:\n\nReview the L'Unita Interview with Fidel Castro and Salvador Allende's speech from this week's Learning Resources.\nChose two elements from the following:\n    \nSocial\nEconomical\nPolitical/governmental\nEnvironmental\n\n\nImagine that you were born near the end of World War II and that you are now a young adult living in a country we read about this past week (so you would be writing in the 1960s), reflecting on the past two decades of the Cold War.\n    \nConsider what you would have experienced and witnessed during the Cold War.\nThink about what it was like to live through the effects of the Cold War.\nDraw from your readings and consider how the events of this era have created changes in the social, political/governmental, religious, and economic arenas of your country and the world.\n\n\n\nThe assignment:\n\nWrite a 1-page journal entry for each of the two elements chosen and evaluate the changes you would have experienced and witnessed during this period of the Cold War.\n\nQuestions about this assignment?

The standard deviation is a  measure of how close together a set of data is grouped. In Chapter 2 of  your text, Kozak (2014) stated:\n“In  general a “small” standard deviation means the data is close together  (more consistent) and a “large” standard deviation means the data is  spread out (less consistent). Sometimes you want consistent data and  sometimes you don’t. As an example if you are making bolts, you want to  lengths to be very consistent so you want a small standard deviation. If  you are administering a test to see who can be a pilot, you want a  large standard deviation so you can tell who are the good pilots and who  are the bad ones.” (p. 89).\nExample Situations Involving Pilots\n\nA large standard deviation tells us that there is a lot of variability in the scores; that is, the distribution of scores is spread out and not clustered around the mean. As Kozak (2104) has stated, when assessing potential pilots, we may want a large standard deviation, so that we can differentiate  between candidates; that is, we can determine who would be good pilots  and those who would not be good pilots. Since a large standard  deviation tells us that there is a lot of variability in the scores, candidates, who would be good pilots, would have scores  far above the mean, while those who would not be good pilots would have  scores far below the mean. Thus, only the \"top\" candidates would be  selected to be pilots.\nA small standard deviation tells us that there is not a lot of variability in a distribution of scores; that is, the scores are very consistent (similar)  and close to the mean. Using our pilot example, a small standard  deviation is desirable, when considering aircraft landing distances. If  there is not enough distance when landing, the aircraft could undershoot  the runway; that is, land short of the runway. On the other hand, if  there is too much distance, the aircraft can overshoot the runway; that  is, the aircraft does not stop before the end of the runway. Both  undershooting and overshooting runways could result in injuries and/or  fatalities. Thus, it is important that pilots have consistent accurate  landing distances. Specifically, over a number of landings, the  distances would, on average, be appropriate to the runway length with  little variation among the distances.\nNow think about how this might apply in your chosen field and answer both of the following questions:\n\nWhat is an example of when you would want consistent data and, therefore, a small standard deviation? \nWhat is an example of when you might want a large standard deviation? That is, data that is more spread out?\n\nReference\nKozak, K. (2014). Statistics using technology.

Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\"\n—U .S. President Ronald Reagan, June 12, 1987\n\nPresident Reagan's speech, \"Tear Down This Wall,\" was at the forefront of the fall of Communism and the Berlin Wall. Nations that were once divided by both physical and political barriers began to work together on a common goal of becoming united as Europe faced the arduous task of rebuilding. As the world looked on, Eastern European nations reentered the world marketplace and began building a solid foundation that would bring with it advancements and new opportunities. This increase in global marketplace traffic created a ripple effect, spiking the need for an increase in science, technology, and communication worldwide.\nAt the same time, the another ripple of this era included the longstanding conflict between Israel and Palestine. In the Middle East, there were struggles over the West Bank, Gaza Strip, the status of the Palestinian state and Jerusalem.\nThis week, you will continue your review of the end of the Cold War. In doing so, you will examine the correlation between the end of the Cold War and how globalization began to rise during that era. You will also discover how the fall of Communism affected the citizens of the European nations. In addition, you will also explore the civil unrest in the Middle East during this time.\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this week, you should be able to:\n\nAssess the role of nationalism in the breakup of the Soviet Union and the conflict in the Middle East\nSelect and defend the biggest change in a country and the lives of the citizens after the collapse of Communism\nIdentify political leaders and events in the Middle East during the post–Cold War era\n\nLearning Resources\nRequired Readings\nReilly, K.

However, we were living much worse than people in the industrialized countries…This country was suffocating in the shackles of the bureaucratic command system. Doomed to cater to ideology, and suffer and carry the onerous burden of the arms race, it found itself at the breaking point…This society has acquired freedom. It has been freed politically and spiritually, and this is the most important achievement that we have yet fully come to grips with. And we haven't, because we haven't learned to use freedom yet.\nWe're now living in a new world. And end has been put to the cold war and to the arms race, as well as to the mad militarization of the country, which has crippled our economy, public attitudes and morals…We are heirs of a great civilization and it now depends on all and everyone whether or not this civilization will make a comeback to a new and decent living today. I would like, from the bottom of my heart, to thank everyone who has stood by me throughout these years, working for the righteous and good cause.\n-Mikael Gorbachev, 1991\n\nIn this Discussion you will be analyzing the reasons behind and consequences of the fall of the Soviet Union, and the impact of its fall on countries across the world.\nTo prepare for this Discussion:\n\nReview Reilley and Lukacs in the Learning Resources.\nRead President Reagan's \"Tear Down This Wall\" speech from this week's Learning Resources and reflect on its impact upon the breakdown of the Soviet Union.\nReview Gorbachev's Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech from this week's Learning Resources.\nThink about the power of nationalism in the United States.\nConsider the weaknesses of the Soviet Union's Communist structure, specifically the governmental and economical aspects.\nDraw from your reading this week as well as past weeks and consider the tensions in the Middle East and how different peoples there view the West.\nAssess the role of nationalism in the breakup of the Soviet Union.\nAssess the role of nationalism in the Middle East conflict.\n\nWith these thoughts in mind:\nBy Day 3\nPost an analysis (2–3 paragraphs) where you address:\n\nThe major reasons why the Soviet Union collapsed.\nThe extent to which Russian people were ready to embrace the reforms that ended the Soviet Union.\nThe impact of the Soviet Union’s collapse on the world.\n\nBe sure to support your ideas by properly citing at least one of week's Learning Resources, in APA format, within your initial post.

However, after nearly 45 years of opposition to such communist regimes, their prediction to came to fruition as the world witnessed the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War era.\nAs you read in Week 2, Churchill geographically defined the Iron Curtain in his \"Sinews of Peace\" speech. He noted that the Iron Curtain was \"erected\" by the Soviet Union to close itself and certain eastern European allies from contact with the West.\n\"From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an \"iron curtain\" has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia; all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject, in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow\" (Churchill, 1946). \nWhile there were physical barriers later erected within areas of Soviet control, the Iron Curtain was not an actual physical barrier, contrary to some people's misunderstanding. Instead, it was a move to form a political, ideological, and military barrier from the West and other non-communist nations post - World War II. While there is debate about how much impact President Ronald Reagan's \"Tear Down This Wall\" speech had on the start of the collapse of Communism, many claim that it changed the world.\nImagine how hard life must have been for those under Soviet control who were effectively imprisoned behind the Iron Curtain. How must they have felt when they heard the news of President Reagan's speech? Was their reaction joy and relief or was it fear of change? In this assignment, you will share your thoughts about what led to the fall of the Soviet Union and how people were affected by the changes.\nTo prepare for this assignment:\n\nResearch one former European Communist country we have read about throughout the term.  \nRead President Reagan's \"Tear Down This Wall\" speech from this week's Learning Resources and reflect upon its impact on the breakdown of the Soviet Union.\nReview Gorbachev's Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance speech from this week's Learning Resources.\nIf necessary, review \"The Sinews of Peace\" (aka \"The Iron Curtain\" speech) from the Week 2 Learning Resources as well as past readings on your country of choice.\nConsider how individuals living in the former Communist Soviet Union were affected by that nation's collapse.\nThink about how social structures were affected after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nDraw from this week's reading and reflect upon the length of the Cold War era and how long it took for Communism to fall.\nCall to mind the differences in the daily lives between individuals living in a democratic nation versus those living in a communist country.\nConsider how much impact President Reagan's speech had on the collapse of communism.\n\nThe assignment:\n\nCompose a 2- to 3-page essay in which you do the following:\nDescribe conditions in your chosen country under communist rule.\n    \nSelect and defend the biggest change in that country and the lives of its citizens after the collapse of Communism.\nWhich element of change had the most impact on that country?\nHow did life change for individuals living in that former Communist nation?\nSupport your assertions by making at least 2 references, in proper APA format, to your course readings.\n\n\n\nQuestions about this assignment?

From the information gathered from the unit lesson, required unit resources, and suggested unit resources, read the Cookie Creations case study below, which is also available on p.11-37 (Chapter 11) and p. 15-38 (Chapter 15) in the textbook. \nThe case study allows you to apply what you have learned about liabilities and the accounting process. This assignment will allow you to practice what you have learned so far. \nPart I\nRecall that Cookie Creations sells fine European mixers that it purchases from Kzinski Supply Company. Kzinski warrants the mixers to be free of defects in material and workmanship for 1 year from the date of original purchase. If the mixer has such a defect, Kzinski will repair or replace the mixer free of charge for parts and labor. The product must be shipped prepaid to an authorized Kzinski service center. The consumer pays the cost to ship the mixer. The cost to return the product to the consumer is paid by Kzinski. \nThe authorized service center is located in Boston. Because Cookie Creations values serving its customers, it pays the shipping to Boston for any mixers needing repair under Kzinski’s warranty terms. Based on past experience, Kzinski has found that approximately 10% of mixers are returned for repair or replacement. The average cost to ship a mixer to Boston is $60. \nThe following transactions take place in 2020 and 2021. \n\nA total of 30 mixers are sold in 2020.\nFour of the mixers sold in 2020 are returned for repair in 2021. The total shipping cost for returning these four mixers to Boston is $210. \nA total of 40 mixers are sold in 2021.\nTwo of the mixers sold in 2021 are returned for repair in 2021. The total shipping cost for returning these two mixers to Boston is $55. \n\nFor Part I of the assignment, complete the tasks listed below using Excel.\n\nCalculate Cookie Creations’ warranty liability for the shipping costs at December 31, 2020.\nRecord the estimated warranty liability at December 31, 2020.\nPrepare the summary journal entry (or entries) to record the shipment of the six mixers (four from the 2020 sales and two from the 2021 sales) for warranty repair in 2021. d. \nCalculate Cookie Creations’ warranty liability at December 31, 2021. (Hint: Note that there is no liability outstanding for the mixers sold in 2020. The 1-year warranty period has expired.)\nRecord the estimated warranty liability at December 31, 2021. (Hint: Similar to accounting for bad debts, consider any existing balance in the warranty liability account when you prepare your entry. You will find it helpful to prepare a general ledger account for the warranty liability and to post the above transactions.) \n\nPart II\nNatalie and Curtis have been experiencing great demand for their cookies and muffins. As a result, they are now thinking about buying a commercial oven. They know which oven they want and that it will cost $17,000. The company already has $5,000 set aside for the purchase and will need to borrow the rest. \nNatalie and Curtis met with a bank manager to discuss their options. She is willing to lend Cookie & Coffee Creations Inc. $12,000 on November 1, 2020, for 3 years at a 5% interest rate. The terms provide for fixed principal payments of $2,000 on May 1 and November 1 of each year plus 6 months of interest. \nFor Part II of the assignment, complete the tasks listed below. \n\nPrepare a payment schedule for the life of the note. \nPrepare the journal entry for the purchase of the oven and the issue of the note payable on November 1, 2020. \nPrepare the journal entries on May 1 and November 1 for the note.\nDetermine the current portion of the note payable and the long-term portion of the note payable at October 31, 2021. \n\nParts I and II should be submitted in a single Excel spreadsheet.

Spirituality has a positive impact on promoting the health of a patient. This paper goes through spiritual care in nursing.\nSpiritual Care in Nursing\nSpiritual care is the part of the care that touches the inner part of a person and their faith to give them a positive outlook and hope in the period of illness. Its purpose to seek resolution, transcend physical and consciousness. Spiritual care is basically on the healing process; it is intrinsically essential throughout human life.\nMy definition is close to the description of the topic readings is to provide spiritual care as an integral part of caring for a patient incorporating religion in nursing assessment. It should be understood by taking into consideration the diverse religious aspect that is available worldwide (Gone & Giske, 2017). Different patients have different spiritual needs, which might be strange to a healthcare provider. It is important to know patient religion and their views, some people believe in witchcraft in Africa, others such as atheists who question the existence of God, and the agnostic who question the existence of God may need emotional care and more listening. Nurses should always be sensitive when assessing patients' spiritual needs, referral to a pastoral caregiver can be another better option or intervention from a relative (Timmins & Caldeira,2017).\nConclusion\nFrom the above findings, spiritual care knowledge is essential to all healthcare providers. The patient needs to feel, love, hope, peace, and gratitude. Nurses need to understand a variety of faith and religion to be successful.\nReferences\nCone, P. H., & Giske, T. (2018). Integrating spiritual care into nursing education and practice: strategies utilizing open journey theory.\nTimmins, F., & Caldeira, S. (2017). Understanding spirituality and spiritual care in nursing. Nursing Standard, 31(22).\nReply 2\n\nRe: Topic 5 DQ 1\n\nSpiritual care can be defined in different manners depending on the situation. When it comes to me, I define it as the care that responds and recognizes what the human spirit need in times of challenges such as sadness, sickness, and disease, trauma as well as recovering from the loss of a loved one. I believe that in administering spiritual care, one should focus on restoring things like the meaning of life, self-worth, self-acceptance, faith, and hope, and generally be supportive. In nursing practice, a practitioner should ensure that they are conversant with the spirituality of a patient before engaging in a spiritual case. Many individuals belong to different cultural backgrounds and religious backgrounds, where there are certain specific practices in their spirituality that they believe in or abide by. As such, a practitioner should ensure that they understand the spirituality of the individual before administering spiritual care for maximum results.\nMy definition relates to Shelly and Miller’s explanation of how spiritual care should be and handled. According to Shelly and Miller (2006), spiritual care involves the use of an individual belief in religion to instill faith and hope in their caregiving process. The researchers insist that spiritual care goes hand in hand with a patient’s religion as well as the practitioner's practices. Religious patients tend to put much faith in their religion for healing and overcoming the diseases. Based on the principle of respect for autonomy, it is upon a practitioner to respect the decision that the patient makes. As such, if a patient is religious and requires spiritual care, it is upon the practitioner to ensure that they achieve this type of care.\nReference\nShelly, J.A. & Miller, A.

She is looking for a new laptop, but she can’t find one she likes. Then, realizing that she is going to be late for an appointment, she attempts to leave the store, walking very fast. However, before she can leave, she is stopped by a security guard who accuses her of shoplifting. Paula, who has taken nothing, denies any wrong doing. The officer insists and takes Paula to a small room in the back of the store. The guard tells Paula that if she attempts to leave the room she will be arrested and sent to jail. At this point, the guard leaves the room. Paula is scared and waits in the room for over an hour until the manager comes in and apologizes and tells Paula that she is free to go.\n\nAbout this same time, Geoffrey Golfer is hitting golf balls in his backyard. Geoffrey decides to break out his new driver and hits a golf ball out of his backyard into the Cash Mart parking lot.

The boyfriend is the child's father. Patient complains of severe lower abdominal pain, although she is afebrile, with normal laboratory values and normal vital signs. No cause of the pain is able to be delineated, and the plan is to take the girl to the operating room to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy. In this case, from whom should informed consent be obtained? Provide an evidence-based reason for your answer.\nAnswer:\nIn this case, informed consent should be obtained from the patient or her parents based on the circumstances. According to U.S. state laws, authorized legal guardians or parents are given the responsibility for informed consent of their child who is a minor. There are however, exemptions for a minor to receive treatment without the informed consent of a parent or guardian. Some exemptions include a married minor, minors seeking treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, emancipated minors, psychiatric inpatient voluntary admissions, or a medical emergency that would place the minor at risk for injury or death. The last exemption relates to this minor’s situation since she is in a state of severe abdominal pain. It would help to have more information from this case, such as the status of her parents or guardian if they are present in her life, but she is in a state of having severe lower abdominal pain, which places her at risk for potential injury. Also, other things should be considered, such as knowing the state nurse practice act, understanding the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) related to minors, and knowing state laws regarding minors to ensure proper protocol when caring for minors under certain situations, in this case, an emergent situation. The boyfriend does not have the right to have informed consent because he is not married to the client, and the client is not stated as emancipated minor either. The client’s emergent situation should allow them to obtain informed consent since their health is at risk (Brent, 2021).\nReferences\nBrent, N. (2021, January 21).

Advance directives are a legally recognized document, and according to the law, the doctors have a responsibility to obey the patient's wish. However, doctors can refuse to comply with the patients' wishes if they consider the decision inappropriate if they object to conscience.\n\nDoes Mr. Gomez’s estranged wife have the authority to step in and ignore Mr. Gomez's advanced directive? Explain your reasoning while providing evidence-based solutions in your conclusion.\n\nA spouse does not have the automatic right to decide on behalf unless appointed as the health care proxy. Mrs. Gomez is estranged, and even though she is still the legal wife, the husband had not taken her and the agent in case of such a situation. Mr. Gomez has a health care proxy who should make decisions on his behalf; the wife can only step in to override the treatment decision if the family agrees that the decision is unappropriated. In this case, the patient is unconscious, and the doctors are not expecting him to regain consciousness.\n\nGomez’s estranged wife has filed temporary order to ignore the advanced directive. If you were Elena, how would you handle this dilemma? What rights does Elena have that allow her to honor her father’s wishes?\n\nThe advanced directive is a guideline that tells of how the patient wants his/her medical decisions made in case one is not in a position to do so; therefore, not even a power of attorney has the right to override this decision. Elena has the right to make decisions on behalf of the father. Consequently, I was her, I would let the mother understand the father's condition where the doctors say that they do not expect him to regain consciousness, and on the other hand, there are the father's wishes.  The father refused to undergo dialysis even though it could help save his life, and without it, he cannot survive. Elena has the role in communicating the father's wish at this time that he cannot do so.\n\nWhat is the ethics committee's role, and how can they best support the client and his family?\n\nEthics committees play an advisory role in healthcare-related dilemmas (\"hospital ethics committee: Solving medical dilemmas,\" 2019). They help the clinicians deal with ethical issues that arise during the clinical practice. The ethics committee carry out their role by providing families and patients with health brochures, which carry information about decision making in treatment, advanced directives, and informing them on their role. The best way that the committee can help the family is by solving the conflict between the mother and the daughter in the best way possible.\nReferences\nThe hospital ethics committee: Solving medical dilemmas.

Situations such as these are common in today’s fast-paced business environment. How does a firm manage drastic changes like this? A good performance management system can help.\nFreeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold is a case in point. The company, which is based in Phoenix, is the second-largest copper mining company in the world. It employs approximately 35,000 workers and has mining operations that span five different continents. But it wasn’t a poor market condition that caused Freeport-McMoRan to shift gears. It was a booming one. During much of the 1990s and 2000s, the price of copper was low—only about 75 cents per pound—making mining less profitable than it had been in the past. Mining a large amount of copper therefore became less of a priority than keeping costs low for Freeport-McMoRan.\nHowever, after the price of copper jumped sharply upward and hit $4.50 a pound, Freeport-McMoRan realized it needed to change its strategy—and fast. It needed to ramp up production and invest in new people and equipment in order to mine as much copper as possible while its price was high. The question became how to implement the change. Compounding the task was the fact that each mine was run separately. The firm’s top managers did not even know how its employees were organized at the separate mines, let alone what their goals were or the metrics they were expected to achieve. The company had also acquired a rival mining company twice its size—Phelps Dodge—which made coordinating the performance of its people and operations even more difficult. In 2013, Freeport-McMoRan went to into a completely new line of business—oil and gas—making the coordination even more difficult.\nTo align the goals of everyone in the company and get all of its various mines performing at top capacity, Freeport-McMoRan needed a new performance management system. The system would hopefully enable the company to quickly implement and monitor the changes needed, while giving it the agility to change strategies again if or when the price of copper dropped.\nMany of the employees who work in its mines and oilfields do not use computers regularly on the job, so Freeport-McMoRan needed a system that was easy to use. For this reason, the company adopted a web-based performance management system that employees could use at home. Initially, the firm rolled out the system to 500 employees as a pilot program. When it proved to be successful, the entire company began to use the system.\nThe software keeps everyone in an organization focused on a company’s most important goals, which can have a strong impact on the firm’s financial performance. It also helps organizations measure the contributions of its employees and to nurture, motivate, and reward employees based on their achievements. “Managers need reliable real-time data and pragmatic e-tools to measure, identify, analyze, and understand their organization’s people capability—and what capability is needed to compete in the future,” explains Jonathon Hogg, with PA Consulting Group, an IT and management consulting firm. The performance system, along with the company’s strategic move into oil and gas seems to be working for Freeport-McMoRan. In 2013, the company posted a 19 percent return to shareholders, despite copper prices plummeting again.",":slug4":"human-resources-strategies-human-resource-management-homework-help-assignment-help-2",":category4":"Human Resource Management homework help",":tag4":"Assignment help",":title5":"Assignment: Business & Finance homework help - business 59",":excerpt5":"Practical Connection AssignmentAt UC, it is a priority that students are provided with strong educational programs and c",":body5":"Practical Connection AssignmentAt UC, it is a priority that students are provided with strong educational programs and courses that allow them to be servant-leaders in their disciplines and communities, linking research with practice and knowledge with ethical decision-making.

This is because they rely entirely on a therapeutic system that is mainly focused on the body structure when basing at the spine. This indicates that the chiropractors alter the body alignments so that there are a pain relief and functionality improvement to aid the body healing process by itself. \nAdditionally, since the leading practice for a chiropractor is the manipulation of the spines, the chiropractic care also entails other things, including manual and altered therapies, postural exercise education and the ergonomic training.  Most of these chiropractors work together with other medical practitioners including doctors, pain experts and surgeons, to relieve pain onto an individual. According to research, it is significant to note that chiropractic therapy is primarily focused on the spinal manipulation of lower back pain (Gliedt et al., 2017). According to the American college of physicians, manipulating the spine together has to be accompanied by health and acupuncture. Besides, the use of chiropractic treatment is also one way of relieving other musculoskeletal related pains. \nFurthermore, when basing at the spinal manipulation, there has been a high reporting of complications, including stroke, which is primarily influenced by spinal manipulation of the neck. This is a rare phenomenon. This indicates the spinal manipulation is one of the kinds of therapy that have been used in the therapeutic movements (Wong et al., 2020). This is often accompanied by a quick and intense pressure on the joints underlie between two vertebrae of the spine.\nReferences\n Gliedt, J. A., Schneider, M. J., Evans, M.

Thus, sessions focus not only on relieving pain and discomfort but also on responding to disruptions before they develop into illnesses.\nJin Shin Jyutsu and Jin Shin Do it’s an effective treatment, can be applied as self-help and also by a trained practitioner, who places the fingertips over clothing on designated pressure points to harmonize and restore the energy flow. Rather than doing something to the body, Jin Shin encourages the body to “let go,” which is seen as the path to awakening one’s awareness of harmony within the self and the universe.\nA session generally lasts about an hour with the client lying on a table fully clothed. The practitioner’s hands act as “jumper cables” to “kick start” the correct flow of energy. A spot on the shoulder may be held at the same time as a spot on the knee. The practitioner uses special sequences of hand positions to stimulate the circulation of energy. The touch is gentle, is steady, and never involves force. It is generally pain-free; any tenderness in a particular area is caused by a blockage and tends to dissipate as the area is held. Some people may feel hot or cold or feel a sensation in another part of the body than the one where the practitioner is working. Most people experience a sense of deep relaxation with Jin Shin Jyutsu and Jin Shin Do (Waldeck, 2011).\nReferences:\nWaldeck, F. (2011). Jin Shin Jyutsu. Munich, Germany: Creative-Story. Wills, P.

Pressure point therapies/acupressure, which has been argued to originate from ancient China, have been established to possess significant therapeutic potential against many ailments. Acupressure is based on muscular tension release by applying pressure on acupoints to balance physiological therapy (Mehta et al., 2017). Based on the Chinese medical theory, the body has acupressure points that can be found along meridians in the body, facilitating the flow of vital physiological energy/ life force referred to as the qi. In acupressure, physicians use their feet, thumbs, palms, fingers, or feet to apply pressure acupoints, thus restoring health and balance.\n Acupressure can be incorporated in nursing practice for pain management. For instance, preliminary studies indicate that acupressure is effective in managing low back pain and headaches. Consequently, acupressure has been identified as useful in managing cancer symptoms and side effects caused by chemotherapy, including pain and nausea, and helps with reducing stress. Nurses can also use acupressure to help patients suffering from arthritis. Acupressure has been established to release endorphins that promote anti-inflammatory effects. Acupressure also helps with relieving pain emanating from menstrual cramps and muscle tension (Wong, 2020). Nevertheless, when seeking chiropractic health intervention, individuals with cancer, diabetes, heart disease, fractures, osteoporosis, and uncontrolled blood pressure should seek medical advice before trying it.\nReferences\nMehta, P., Dhapte, V., Kadam, S., & Dhapte, V.

Is this a double standard?\nAnswer\nCases of sexual assault have significantly increased in many parts of the world. Notably, stereotypes, beliefs, culture, and norms are fundamental factors that have made it challenging to address sexual assault cases. For instance, in the case attached, it is evident that society has stereotyped sexual assault as a criminal act that can only be perpetrated by men. The United States' laws have achieved a significant milestone in protecting minorities from all forms of sexual assaults (Jessup-Anger, Lopez, & Koss, 2018). Hence, under the two cases highlighted, adults should be held accountable for engaging in sexual relations with a minor.\nThe woman in the case attached has committed a serious sexual offense for agreeing to engage in a sexual relationship with a 17 years underage boy. Hence, if the court gathers sufficient evidence to prove the woman's consent regarding the boy's age, she will be prosecuted for deliberately assaulting a minor. Many societies hold that men have the jurisdiction to make informed sexual choices and decisions regardless of age (Spohn, 2020). As a result, the notion has significantly hindered the efforts to protect the underaged boys from intentional sexual assaults.\nThe adequate sensitization of society about the nature, causes, and effects of sexual assaults, especially regarding minors, is one of the basic strategies that can be used to initiate equality in the protection of underage boys and girls. Besides, it is paramount to eliminate the impartiality in determining cases regarding the assault of both boys and girls (Swan, 2020). Notably, the United States' laws perceive minors as incapable of making accurate and informed decisions. Hence, adults and the laws must protect underage boys and girls from all forms of sexual assaults.\nReferences\nJessup-Anger, J. E., Lopez, E., & Koss, M. P. (2018).

Is this a double standard?\n\n\n\n \nIt is wrong for an adult to have a romantic relationship with a minor, even if both parties consent to the arrangement. Tener (2018) mentions that romantic relationships between an adult and minors are legally prohibited. Therefore, irrespective that the underage is male and consensual to the arrangement, the relationship should be reported to law enforcement and the welfare system. The woman should be charged in court to take advantage of a minor and exploit him sexually.\nA sexual relationship between an underage male and an adult female is most likely to be perceived as sexual initiation rather than sexual exploitation. Expressly, it is likely that the 17-year-old is the one who pursued the woman. Notwithstanding, Hines and Finkelhor (2007) indicate that the arrangement is still considered statutory rape by law. In this case, the woman should be prosecuted for getting into a sexual relationship with a minor. Indeed, the 17-year-old should still be considered a minor. The law indicates that adults are persons of 18 years and above. Thus, a 17-year-old is still supposed to be under parental care and most likely in school. Moreover, the 17-year-old mind is not yet fully matured to handle the liability of sexual relationships, such as pregnancy or STIs.\nA reversed role of the scenario is the most frequent statutory relationship. The law puts similar energy into minor and adult sexual relationships irrespective of which gender is the minor. Nonetheless, underage female and the adult male is more dangerous as the adolescent risks getting pregnant and bearing the financial burden of rearing a child.\nReferences\nHines, D.

How would you as the crisis worker handle them?\nWhat are some of the domestic violence intervention strategies? Pick one and how would you apply it to the scenario\n\nAnswer\n \nThe number of factors that lead to domestic Violence can be internal or external, and while the emergence of these factors cannot be clearly described, these risk factors are diverse. For instance, there are individual factors that are related to, either the victim or perpetrator, include low age which is associated with the level of their maturity, physical and psychological predispositions.—excessive consumption of alcohol by one of the partners and the use of other narcotics as well. Individuals who abuse drugs are likely to fall victim to abusive partners. Victims need acceptance and support to maintain their habit, causing them to be vulnerable. Mental illness is also a contributing factor to domestic Violence. Individuals who suffer from depression and mood disorders are likely to be victims of domestic Violence. \nThe dynamic that I see in this case scenario is that the victim has a low self-esteem. Low self-esteem plays a critical role in exacerbating domestic Violence. Often victims believe they are not worthy of anyone’s love and are therefore more likely to endure abuse in the hope of the abuser changing. On the contrary, the perpetrators hide their low self-esteem by degrading others. Also, the desire for power or control can cause domestic Violence as the abuser attempt to control the victim’s social life, travel, and money. Additionally, the previous history of being abused without intervention can, unfortunately, continue the domestic violence cycle. Usually, earlier victims of abusive behavior are either re-victimized or become the perpetrators. Most victims possess the mentality of deserving the abuse leaving them to be defenseless. On the other hand, victims who become abusers do so under the basis of being angry and frustrated concerning their experience as victims. \nNurses can play a crucial role in reducing the consequences of aby intervening through different techniques. Asking about domestic Violence, for instance, is an effective intervention. Research shows that direct inquiry from a caring health practitioner helped victims of domestic Violence disclose their abuse and find the appropriate intervention processes. (Bullock, et al.,11) Additionally, asking about abuse is a critical nursing intervention in addressing domestic Violence. Empathetic inquiry by a nurse shows a survivor that nurses care and are well informed about domestic Violence.\nUsually, it is difficult to witness victims of domestic Violence remain in such relationships. Nevertheless, it’s their decision, and as such, nurses should not force a victim to end the relationship. Such pressure could insinuate that her decision to stay in her way of asking for it, which could worsen the case (Scott-Tilley, 3). Once a nurse has done all they can, it is wise to respect the patient by leaving the situation in her hands and informing her to return whenever she can.\nReferences\nBullock, Linda FC, Judith A.

How would you as the crisis worker handle them?\nWhat are some of the domestic violence intervention strategies? Pick one and how would you apply it to the scenario\n\nAnswer\n \n1\nRationalization could be observed. When talking to the crisis worker, Joyce is observed attempting to explain why his husband became violent with her and her children. She fails to recognize his husband's violent nature by arguing that his work could have triggered his violence. She also notes that the food was cold, and they were supposed to go about when her husband arrived, which could be why he became angry and violent. Guilt can also be identified; Joyce contemplates whether her husband's complaints coming home late led to her husband being violent.  \n2\nCrisis-oriented services and the first response team's interventions can be provided to Joyce. The first response team comprising trained advocates who accompany the police officers responding to domestic violence calls can effectively deter offenders of legal consequences of violent behavior (Stark & Buzawa, 2009). First response teams also inform the victim about the available community services and resources available. Counseling services can also be provided to Joyce to empower her to regain her sense of personal power. \nChildren intervention services are also effective for Joyce's case. Presently, domestic violence victim service programs incorporate children's services since they are equally affected by the violence perpetrated both to their mothers and themselves. For instance, both Joyce and her children experienced were physically assaulted. The children intervention services include counseling, support, and education groups where the children are taught how to deal with anger, label their feelings, and developing safety skills.\nReferences\nStark, E., & Buzawa, E.

She had been suffering from emphysema for several years and had had frequent hospitalizations for respiratory problems. On the last hospital admission, her pneumonia quickly progressed to organ failure. Death appeared to be imminent, and she went in and out of consciousness, alone in her hospital room. The medical-surgical nursing staff and the nurse manager focused on making Mrs. Smith’s end-of-life period as comfortable as possible. Upon consultation with the vice president for nursing, the nurse manager and the unit staff nurses decided against moving Mrs. Smith to the palliative care unit, although considered more economical, because of the need to protect and nurture her because she was already experiencing signs and symptoms of the dying process. Nurses were prompted by an article they read on human caring as the “language of nursing practice” (Turkel, Ray, & Kornblatt, 2012) in their weekly caring practice meetings.\n\nThe nurse manager reorganized patient assignments. She felt that the newly assigned clinical nurse leader who was working between both the medical and surgical units could provide direct nurse caring and coordination at the point of care (Sherman, 2012). Over the next few hours, the clinical nurse leader and a staff member who had volunteered her assistance provided personal care for Mrs. Smith. The clinical nurse leader asked the nurse manager whether there was a possibility that Mrs. Smith had any close friends who could “be there” for her in her final moments. One friend was discovered and came to say goodbye to Mrs. Smith. With help from her team, the clinical nurse leader turned, bathed, and suctioned Mrs. Smith. She spoke quietly, prayed, and sang hymns softly in Mrs. Smith’s room, creating a peaceful environment that expressed compassion and a deep sense of caring for her. The nurse manager and nursing unit staff were calmed and their “hearts awakened” by the personal caring that the clinical nurse leader and the volunteer nurse provided. Mrs. Smith died with caring persons at her bedside, and all members of the unit staff felt comforted that she had not died alone.\n\nDavidson, Ray, and Turkel (2011) note that caring is complex, and caring science includes the art of practice, “an aesthetic which illuminates the beauty of the dynamic nurse-patient relationship, that makes possible authentic spiritual-ethical choices for transformation—healing, health, well-being, and a peaceful death” (p. xxiv). As the clinical nurse leader and the nursing staff in this situation engaged in caring practice that focused on the well-being of the patient, they simultaneously created a caring-healing environment that contributed to the well-being of the whole—the emotional atmosphere of the unit, the ability of the clinical nurse leader and staff nurses to practice caringly and competently, and the quality of care the staff were able to provide to other patients. The bureaucratic nature of the hospital included leadership and management systems that conferred power, authority, and control to the nurse manager, the clinical nurse leader, and the nursing staff in partnership with the vice president for nursing. The actions of the nursing administration, clinical nurse leader, and staff reflected values and beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors about the nursing care they would provide, how they would use technology, and how they would deal with human relationships. The ethical and spiritual choice making of the whole staff and the way they communicated their values both reflected and created a caring community in the workplace culture of the hospital unit.\n\nCritical thinking activities\n\nBased on this case study, consider the following questions.\n\n1. What caring behaviors prompted the nurse manager to assign the clinical nurse leader to engage in direct caring for Mrs. Smith? Describe the clinical nurse leader role established by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing in 2004.\n2. What issues (ethical, spiritual, legal, social-cultural, economic, and physical) from the structure of the theory of bureaucratic caring influenced this situation? Discuss end-of-life issues in relation to the theory.\n3. How did the nurse manager balance these issues? What considerations went into her decision making? Discuss the role and the value of the clinical nurse leader on nursing units. What is the difference between the nurse manager and the clinical nurse leader in terms of caring practice in complex hospital care settings? How does a clinical nurse leader fit into the theory of bureaucratic caring for implementation of a caring practice?\n4. What interrelationships are evident between persons in this environment—that is, how were the vice president for nursing, nurse manager, clinical nurse leader, staff, and patient connected in this situation? Compare and contrast the traditional nursing process with Turkel, Ray, and Kornblatt’s (2012) language of caring practice within the theory of bureaucratic caring\n\nWhat is the difference between grand theory and middle-range theory?\nGrand theory is broader and provides an overall framework for structuring ideas.\nIn description, Grand Theories are broad and complex in scope. They present a conceptual framework for identifying the key principles and concepts of the nursing practice. Even though they are known to provide intuitions useful for practice, they cannot be used for empirical testing.\nGeneral Systems Theory - Imogene King\nModeling and Role Modeling Theory - Erickson, Tomlin, and Swain\nTranscultural Nursing (formerly Culture-Care) - Madeleine Leininger\nConservation Model - Myra Estrine Levine\nHealth as Expanding Consciousness - Margaret Newman\nNursing Process Theory - Ida Jean Orlanda\nTheory of Human Becoming - Rosemarie Rizzo Parse\nHumanistic Nursing - Josephine Paterson and Loretta Zderad\nInterpersonal Relations Model - Hildegard E Peplau\nScience of Unitary Human Beings - Martha E Rogers\nRoy Adaptation Model - Sister Callista Roy\nPhilosophy and Theory of Transpersonal Caring - Jean Watson\nEmancipated Decision Making in Health Care - Wittman-Price\nSelf-Care Theory - Dorothea Orem\nOn the other hand, middle-range theories are focused on a particular phenomenon or concept.

So, what trends are being addressed and why?\n2)The big outlays that are on the horizon.  Obviously, health care and retirement costs are always front and center, but what about them will cost money.  As you go through the readings you want to try to get a handle on what might be controllable from what appears to be more difficult to control.\n3)Where the money comes from. I gave you various readings addressing revenue from different sources(income tax, Social Security Trust Fund, payroll tax, capital gains tax, for example).  You may want to think in terms of the strengths and weaknesses of these different revenue sources.  What can we expect from the income tax as a source of government revenue in the future and why? The capital gains tax as a percentage of total revenue collected and whether it can significantly matter or not and why.  The pressures placed on the Social Security Trust Fund and what that means to it contributing to financing the government. \nThe focus is then what your paper needs to address. In your essay address what you see as important about the Federal budget and why.  This is a very broad statement so you need to determine why you are analyzing specific aspects of the budget—and explaining why you are focusing your attention on specific issues. I do not want this to be a general essay—you need to get to specifics within the readings.  There is a great deal of detailed information presented in these readings so demonstrate how you use it in your essay. Here is the importance of the notes you took--that you draw upon them to write your essay.

On Dece",":body17":"KATIE'S POST:\n The crisis case I chose to discuss this week is the Tennessee Valley and the Kingston ash slide. On December 22, 2008, Tennessee Valley Authority who uses coal to generate electricity, had one of their containment pods that holds sludge from the ash wall begin to leak. The leak then caused the wall to eventually crumble. The leak then flowed into the Emory River that is located nearby. The river flowed into a nearby community, destroyed several houses, and forced families to evacuate the area.\n\nChapter 5 discusses the importance of organization members accepting that crisis can start quickly and unexpectedly. Two months before the leak, TVA was informed of a wet spot located on one retaining wall that suggested a leak was present. The moisture was eroding the structure's integrity, but TVA continued to add ash to the pond. TVA organization leaders ignored the warning signs of a potential crisis. TVA then accepted blame for the spill and began dredging the Emory River shortly after the incident. No other independent party was allowed to assess the dredging plan before it launched. If TVA's plan failed, the organization would have been at fault once again.\n\nUpon further investigation of the crisis, lawyers were able to identify six primary failures in TVA's systems, controls, standards, and culture. “Lack of clarity and accountability for ultimate responsibility, lack of standardization, training, and metrics, siloed responsibilities and poor communication, lack of checks and balances, lack of prevention priority and resources, and being reactive instead of proactive” (Ulmer, Sellnow,& Seeger, 87).\n\nUnfortunately, this unintentional crises could have been avoided had the proper crisis management, quality assurance, and procedures been put in place. TVA's negligence cost people their homes, polluted the river, and the uncertainty of long-term health conditions from being exposed to the ash's toxins. \"The community was not able to locate reliable information about potential short- and long-term health effects, uncertainty about the extent of environmental damage, and feared plummeting property values\" (Ritchie, Little, & Campbell, 179). TVA was at fault for several things, but the most significant fault they did not consider is the risk of storing large volumes of fly ash near the Emory River that flowed into a nearby community.\n\nUlmer, R.

She had been suffering from emphysema for several years and had had frequent hospitalizations for respiratory problems. On the last hospital admission, her pneumonia quickly progressed to organ failure. Death appeared to be imminent, and she went in and out of consciousness, alone in her hospital room. The medical-surgical nursing staff and the nurse manager focused on making Mrs. Smith’s end-of-life period as comfortable as possible. Upon consultation with the vice president for nursing, the nurse manager and the unit staff nurses decided against moving Mrs. Smith to the palliative care unit, although considered more economical, because of the need to protect and nurture her because she was already experiencing signs and symptoms of the dying process. Nurses were prompted by an article they read on human caring as the “language of nursing practice” (Turkel, Ray, & Kornblatt, 2012) in their weekly caring practice meetings. \nThe nurse manager reorganized patient assignments. She felt that the newly assigned clinical nurse leader who was working between both the medical and surgical units could provide direct nurse caring and coordination at the point of care (Sherman, 2012). Over the next few hours, the clinical nurse leader and a staff member who had volunteered her assistance provided personal care for Mrs. Smith. The clinical nurse leader asked the nurse manager whether there was a possibility that Mrs. Smith had any close friends who could “be there” for her in her final moments. One friend was discovered and came to say goodbye to Mrs. Smith. With help from her team, the clinical nurse leader turned, bathed, and suctioned Mrs. Smith. She spoke quietly, prayed, and sang hymns softly in Mrs. Smith’s room, creating a peaceful environment that expressed compassion and a deep sense of caring for her. The nurse manager and nursing unit staff were calmed and their “hearts awakened” by the personal caring that the clinical nurse leader and the volunteer nurse provided. Mrs. Smith died with caring persons at her bedside, and all members of the unit staff felt comforted that she had not died alone. \nDavidson, Ray, and Turkel (2011) note that caring is complex, and caring science includes the art of practice, “an aesthetic which illuminates the beauty of the dynamic nurse-patient relationship, that makes possible authentic spiritual-ethical choices for transformation—healing, health, well-being, and a peaceful death” (p. xxiv). As the clinical nurse leader and the nursing staff in this situation engaged in caring practice that focused on the well-being of the patient, they simultaneously created a caring-healing environment that contributed to the well-being of the whole—the emotional atmosphere of the unit, the ability of the clinical nurse leader and staff nurses to practice caringly and competently, and the quality of care the staff were able to provide to other patients. The bureaucratic nature of the hospital included leadership and management systems that conferred power, authority, and control to the nurse manager, the clinical nurse leader, and the nursing staff in partnership with the vice president for nursing. The actions of the nursing administration, clinical nurse leader, and staff reflected values and beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors about the nursing care they would provide, how they would use technology, and how they would deal with human relationships. The ethical and spiritual choice making of the whole staff and the way they communicated their values both reflected and created a caring community in the workplace culture of the hospital unit. \n1. What caring behaviors prompted the nurse manager to assign the clinical nurse leader to engage in direct caring for Mrs. Smith?

They present a conceptual framework for identifying the key principles and concepts of the nursing practice.

Based off what you have told me, you want to know what is AHDH and The difference between ADHD? Why do you feel that this maybe the wrong diagnosed for Tonya? Alone with the right treatment plan and medication client should be okay. Medication is a major assets to overcome these type of diagnoses. I want you to know that you are making all the right choices to be proactive with this diagnoses going without having this cared for has short term and long term consequences. Short term it has a big effect on the brain and long term causes struggles with keep relationship. Long term there no cure for ADHD and looking for jump into a state environment. I’m sorry y’all had to come this time and offer gain knowledge. Everyone learn a different ways to discuss what come and stay come go.

Mil)\nMini Script\nI hear that this diagnosis is new and it may take some time to get used to this. I understand that the idea of your daughter taking medication is new as well. You stated concern with Tonya taking a stimulant medication. There are options for non-stimulant medication. One medication is called Intuniv. It is a common non-stimulant drug. Some side effects include feeling tired or irritable, nausea, and dizziness/drowsiness (Drugs.com, 2021). If you are interested, we can also discuss stimulant medication such as Adderall, Ritalin, or Concerta. It is important to maintain contact with me. As counseling will provide you (mom) with the tools necessary to handle Tonya’s ADHD. Also, Tonya studies show that counseling will help improve your self-esteem and give you a sense of independence (Sinacola, Peters-Strickland & Wyner, 2020). \nLastly, untreated ADHD as a child makes them more at risk for drug abuse (Wolraich, Brown, Brown, Dupaul, Earls & Visser, 2011). In adults, issues with concentration and a decrease in the desire in activities (Sinacola, Peters-Strickland & Wyner, 2020). \nTwo Questions about diagnoses\nTonya, when you are at school do you find it hard to concentrate or stay focused on your teachers? If so, when this happens what typically occurs?\nTonya, can you tell me your thoughts about your ADHD diagnosis?\nGoing further with Tonya\nTonya’s diagnosis is new and seems scary to the family. It is important that Tonya’s family make a decision on beginning stimulant or non-stimulant medication. The text does discuss the options for lowering sugar intake along with attending counseling. Tonya’s mother has an important decision to make and bringing Tonya in on the decision making will help as well. \nReferences\nDrugs.com.(27, January 2021). Guanfacine.

Dav)\nMain Post\nTonya is a 10-year-old adolescent whose parents have come to you because of a recent diagnosis of ADHD by Tonya’s pediatrician. Tonya’s parents do not understand how a person is diagnosed with AHDH. They have heard that all ADHD medications are stimulant based and have a high risk for creating substance dependence. Tonya appears motivated to please her parents and teacher but is easily distracted and disengaged. She does not have a history of abusing medications; all medications would be dispensed by Tonya’s mother.    \nWrite out a mini script showing what you, Tonya’s counselor, would say to her parents.\nProvide two potential questions you might ask about Tonya’s diagnosis.\nExplain the role of behavioral counseling alongside a diagnosis of ADHD.\nExplain the potential short-term and long-term consequences of not treating ADHD.\nInclude an empathetic reflection to Tonya’s parents.\nI can imagine that this is a scary and difficult position for you to be in right now.  There is a lot of misinformation out there regarding ADHD and available treatment options.  Navigating through it all can be daunting, but I’m here to help you get through it.  Together, I believe we can work with Tonya’s doctor to come up with a care plan that works best for her.  Studies have shown that the most effective treatment approach involves a combination of both counseling and medication.  The counseling aspect includes education around things like coping strategies, conflict management, parenting skills, and even meal planning.  The medications address the physiological effects of ADHD, such as the regulation of dopamine and norepinephrine, which are key hormones that affect mood and behavior.  There are a variety of medications used to treat ADHD, and they usually fall into one of two categories.  One category is stimulants, which includes medications like Adderall or Ritalin.  The other category is antidepressants, such as Effexor or Wellbutrin.  The key to all of this though is to remember that for any treatment plan to work well, whether with or without medication, it is important for patients and families to be educated about the condition itself, as well as to set up realistic expectations regarding treatment (Sinacola, Peters-Strickland, & Wyner, 2020).\nGiven that this education is key, it is important for me to understand what your baseline of understanding is so we can address any concerns and/or misunderstandings you may have before we move further with developing a plan for Tonya.  So first, I’d like to ask you a couple of questions.  1) What do you know about ADHD? Based on what you said initially, it sounds like you’re concerned about the risk of substance abuse connected with ADHD medications.  We will definitely address this further as we take a closer look at treatment options, but for now, let me ask you another question.  2) What is your biggest fear or concern regarding Tonya’s diagnosis?\nIt’s clear to me that you both love your daughter, and that you want what is best for her.  That’s why I’m glad that you’re here today to learn more about her diagnosis and to take the steps necessary to develop a treatment plan that will allow her to thrive as she lives with this condition.  Although your concerns regarding the risks associated with medications used for treatment are valid, the risks associated with not effectively treating Tonya’s ADHD may be greater.  There are short-term risks, such as poor academic performance, but studies have shown that despite the concerns for addiction associated with medical stimulant use, the long-term risk of poly-drug and nonmedical stimulant use increase without proper ADHD treatment (Sinacola et al., 2020).\nResource:\nSinacola, R.

Small businesses help to keep rural and urban communities flourishing.  Most of the time, the only businesses that wish to come into these neighborhoods are small business owners.",":slug6":"need-in-12-hours-or-less-business-finance-homework-help-12-hours-12",":category6":"Business & Finance homework help",":tag6":"12 hours",":title7":"Reflector assesso respondo - Assignment help",":excerpt7":"Answer the following questions as you respond to the responses below\n\nInsight on a solution to an identified peer challe",":body7":"Answer the following questions as you respond to the responses below\n\nInsight on a solution to an identified peer challenge.\nResources that may be helpful related to your peers’ post.\n\nRespomse 1\n In this week’s reading topics, I have found that skin the skin assessment will likely be a challenging section for me in the future. Skin, hair and nails assessments can be very tricky due to the level of difficulty in differentiating between the different skin conditions. While I typically do frequent skin assessments in my current occupation, I do not go very in depth with my skin assessment, typically looking for any skin breakdown or excoriation during their hospital visit. This type of assessment in an outpatient setting done by a provider is very different from the type of assessment that I conduct currently. Also, there are many different skin conditions that look similar to others. This can include superficial basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma in situ, as well as nodular basal cell carcinoma and sebaceous hyperplasia (Bickley, 2016). Though these skin conditions may look similar, further testing will be necessary in order to differentiate between the two, as treatment can be very different for each condition.\n       I have found through my reading that skin assessments in newborns can be particularly challenging, as there are many skin conditions that are common in newborns. Again, differentiating between these skin conditions can be challenging. It is important to distinguish between typical or benign skin conditions and more severe skin conditions or diseases in order to diagnose and treat at the earliest possible time (Kutlubay et al., 2017). After this course and through experience, I should be able to quickly diagnose many of these conditions in order to ensure that my patients get the necessary treatment. Though skin conditions can be challenging, I look forward to learning as much as I can in order to have the ability to provide high quality care to my patients across the lifespan\n\nResponse 2\n Some challenges I anticipate in conducting the skin and abdominal assessment are detecting irregularities in age related skin changes, identifying issues such as melanomas in a wide variety of skin tones and conducting an abdominal assessment on someone with excess abdominal girth. The process of aging presents many potential complications for integrity of skin for elders. In older adults and elderly loss of elasticity, dry skin, as well as reduced adipose tissue tend to make skin tears and lesions easier to occur, along with moisture related breakdown and pressure ulcer development as reported by Todd (2018). Sun exposure can increase melanoma risk, Bickley (2017) discusses how skin assessment as part of routine exam can help detect skin cancers earlier resulting in easier treatment.\n     When examining infants and young children it may be difficult to get them to stay still long enough to evaluate abdomen thoroughly. In examining patients with developmental delay or cognitive impairment it may be difficult to get cooperation from the individual due to fear or lack of understanding. Examining abdomen of obese patients can be difficult due to excess adipose tissue interference, Reuben (2016) reports that in patients with central obesity it can be difficult to detect enlargement of organs, and fluid during abdominal exam. Conducting a thorough abdominal assessment can reduce the need for unnecessary radiological investigations but can be difficult in obese patients as noted by Mealie, Ali & Manthey (2020).",":slug7":"reflector-assesso-respondo-assignment-help",":category7":"Nursing homework help",":tag7":"Assignment help",":title8":"NEED IN 12 HOURS or LESS: Business & Finance homework help - Hours 13",":excerpt8":"In today's volatile market, what do you think is the most important step in capital budgeting financial analysis?

The Keurig K-Cups® were invented in 1992 by John Sylvan. Like any innovator, Sylvan was looking for a better way. For him, it was finding a better way to provide his 30–40 daily cups of coffee in a way that was customizable and easy.  The single-serve brewing pod he created became the Keurig K-Cup. Interesting note: Keurig translates to “neat” in Dutch, and the Keurig machine and its ubiquitous K-Cup arequite neat. The single-brew machine is a very efficient and convenient alternative to the traditional coffee pot or to stopping and picking up drive-through coffee every morning.  However, what Sylvan didn’t anticipate was (1) the overwhelming popularity of the approach and (2) the amount of waste the single-serve pods would create because of that popularity.\nToday, almost one in three homes has a pod-based coffee machine. And the sales of those pods accounted for a vast majority of the revenues of the company that makes them—Keurig Green Mountain. The company’s mission is “A Keurig brewer on every counter and a beverage for every occasion.”  And the company is taking another step toward that goal of a beverage for every occasion through its partnership with Coca-Cola Company. It will begin selling, at the end of 2015, a machine called “Keurig Cold,” which will be used to dispense Coke’s various brands. The Dr Pepper Snapple group also recently signed on to allow its flavor options for the new machine.  Although the Keurig machine is popular and a convenience, it also has a more troubling characteristic: the constant need to buy more K-Cups. They’re designed as single-serve, and with 9.8 billion of them sold in 2014, that’s a lot of K-Cups hitting landfills, because they are not recyclable. Those 9.8 billion K-Cups would circle the globe more than 12 times.\nEnvironmentalists have criticized the company for its slow response to creating and selling a recyclable version of the pod. And it’s not that it can’t be done. For instance, when the K-Cup design patent expired in 2012, other companies brought out single-serve cups that are completely biodegradable and recyclable. To further highlight the sustainability issue, an anonymous YouTube video called “Kill the K-Cup” hit the Internet in early 2015. The apocalyptic nature of the video highlighted the extreme waste and irresponsibility of continuing to make coffee in a way “that simply cannot be sustained.”  It was eventually revealed that the creator of the video was a production company in Halifax, Nova Scotia, whose employees loved their Keurig until they began to notice the growing pile of discarded K-Cups that, despite great Canadian recycling programs, could not easily be recycled.\nSo what does the company say? Keurig’s chief sustainability officer, Monique Oxender, says that the company isn’t happy with its track record either. In 2014, the company pledged to create a fully recyclable version of the K-Cup by 2020. Of course, the critics have jumped all over the 2020 goal saying that five years is a long time to continue to fill up landfills and pointing out that the plastic used in the K-Cups will never be able to be fully recyclable because of the type of plastic it is. In its annual sustainability report, Keurig Green Mountain describes its efforts to strengthen its global citizenship and sustainability leadership.71 (Links to an external site.) Others have said that despite the outcry against the K-Cups, there are some sustainability benefits to the Keurig machine and its single-serve pods. For instance, they’re likely to save electricity over a coffee pot that’s constantly “on” to keep the coffee warm. Also, the pods have been shown to be a more efficient way of extracting coffee from grounds, thus saving resources. And other approaches to coffee making likely use more water in brewing coffee that may not actually be consumed and then dumped down the drain.

After all previously assigned simulation work has been completed, the Summary Annual Report Template will be accessible through the Annual Report tab.\nThe summary annual report is a scaled down version of a full annual report. You will simply not have enough detail to complete the typical nine sections. For example, you are not responsible for the Auditor’s Report. Naturally, you are encouraged to review real world annual reports which can be used as a strawman in preparation. Your recently completed Annual Operating Review in Week 5 should be aligned with your Annual Report.\nPreparing your HISCO summary annual report will be one of the most comprehensive assignments you will have completed during your MBA. You will gain an appreciation for the complexity and responsibility the senior executives continually face. Hopefully, you have experienced the holistic and competitive environment from the simulation. Your recently completed Annual Operating Review will provide the basics.\nThe information, qualitative and quantitative, in an annual report should provide current and prospective investors (as well as any stakeholder) a complete insight into the company’s historic performance and its plans for growth and improvement over the next few years as defined by its strategy. Publicly traded companies are required by law to prepare and submit to many constituencies a variety of filings.  The most well-known is the Annual Report to Shareholders and related Form 10-K. An annual report is technically an unofficial document. The Form 10-K will typically provide the most comprehensive summary of the company’s history, financials, risks and opportunities, and current operations. The Form 10-K is submitted annually to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Technically, HISCO is a private company (you may have sold equity to the venture capitalist) and only if it had publicly trades debt would be required to file a Form 10K.\nAs a future leader of a public or private company, you will learn the integrative nature of any business while you complete the HISCO summary annual report.  This document can become an important part of your e-portfolio in the program.  Your owner, Stanley Sloane, looks forward to reading your HISCO summary annual report.  While details may vary state by state, even if your career leads to growing a small private business, you will need to file an annual report with The Secretary of State in your jurisdiction, another benefit to learning from our final activity.\nThe following identifies specifics instructions for preparation of each required section.  The required sections to be completed will be found the word document from the model. Please remember to periodically save your work.  An online search will reveal innumerable sites devoted to annual reports.\nThe HISCO Summary Annual Report\n\nMust be completed using the template provided through the Growing Your Business simulation.\nFor technical help with the simulation, please email [email protected] \nFollow the Summary Annual Report Template as a guide to formatting your work. Standard APA formatting will not apply to this assignment.\nMust include the following:\n    \nCover Page \n        \nYou can design your own cover page. Should be reflective of your corporate image and may include a picture and/or logo. At a minimum, it will include the name, [simulation year] HISCO Summary Annual Report, as well as your name and date. The cover page can only be 1 page. \n\n\nCEO Letter \n        \nThe CEO Letter is designed to share the Strategy, Financial Highlight Summary, and Business Overview of the past year. Evaluate quantitative and qualitative techniques for business analysis and decision-making. It will typically also include the future growth outlook for the business (detailed in the Sales, Marketing and Industry pages below). The CEO Letter can be a maximum of 3 pages.  \n\n\nThe \"Stan Sloane Letter\"\n\nHISCO’s owner, Stan Sloane, is very happy that he decided to hire you to help turn the company around. He is interested in having you stay on with the company. However, he will need assurance from you that you are committed to continuing to grow HISCO. Explain to Stan how you plan on running the company over the next two years. You should discuss the majority of the items you developed when you first came on with the company, including: whether you would make any changes to the SWOT analysis, whether you would change the company strategy, negotiations you would make with company stakeholders, future technology suggestions, growth expectations in general for the industry and specifically for HISCO over the next two years, any concerns that occurred in the past year that you would address, and any other information you believe would be relevant in order to reassure Stan that he has placed the company in the right hands. You will add this letter at the end of the standard Annual Report. This letter is not part of a traditional Annual Report. The “Stan Sloane Letter” can be 3-4 pages.\n\n\nSales, Marketing, & Industry \n        \nThis section should detail all aspects of HISCO’s Value Chain, from supplier to manufacturing to the customer. Products, NPIs, Pricing, in an industry perspective of competition should be elaborated on. Utilize tools from marketing to manage the profitability of overall business operations. A review of your SWOT would probably help as well as your recently completed Annual Operating Review. An essential element is for current and prospective investors to understand how HISCO makes money and will be able to create growth and deal with risks. The Sales, Marketing & Industry section can be a maximum of 5 pages.\n\n\nFinancial Statements \n        \nFinancial statements are the heart and soul of the annual report. This is a quantitative section that provides current and prospective investors a look into HISCOs financial performance. The financial statements consist of the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow. We suggest you show a minimum of 4 Qtrs. for each of the past two years for the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow. Utilize tools from finance management to manage the profitability of overall business operations. Consider expanding the lines within each statement in the model. You will need to provide details on the Credit Line. The Financial Statements section can be a maximum of 6 pages. \n\n\nManagement Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) \n        \nThe Management Discussion and Analysis section provides the real detail on year to year performance. In your case, this will be simulation year vs. prior simulation year. Topics will be both qualitative and quantitative in all aspects of simulation year relative to prior simulation year. MD&A will certainly include a complete variance analysis of performance and the successes and failures of your decisions for the year.  It is the time you will delve into the details of your operating decisions. The MD&A section is typically devoted to the past (your future was described in prior sections). Reference to the Financial Statements is crucial as well as your recently completed Annual Operating Review. Graphics from your Business Intelligence Dashboard and your Variance walks on Income and Cash can provide visual insight into your performance. The Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) can be a maximum of 6 pages. \n\n\nNotes, Appendices, and References \n        \nAny supporting documents, comments, information, a glossary of terminology, and/or clarifications you deem relevant to your annual report to assist current and prospective investors. The Notes, Appendices, and References are required and can be a minimum of 1 page and a maximum of 2 pages.  References can be in a bulleted or numbered format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarefully review the Grading Rubric (Links to an external site.) for the criteria that will be used to evaluate your assignment.\nPlease note that if you are experiencing technical issues with the Growing Your Business simulation, you will need to contact the help desk within the simulation at [email protected].",":slug15":"final-paper-business",":category15":"Business & Finance homework help",":tag15":"business",":title16":"Evidence-Based Practice and the Quadruple Aim - Help",":excerpt16":"I need help with these two homework questions.

The specific community health issue and target population selected for this intervention must be a verifiable health topic and target in your specific community. Then, using any of the theories/models discussed in this course, you will create an intervention to address this public health issue. The constructs of the theory/model chosen must be used in the creation of the intervention to address the selected population health issue. The resulting intervention must attempt to impact health behaviors or threats to the health and well-being of the selected target population.\nThis Assignment is about being creative and innovative, within the confines of evidence-based theory and producing an intervention. Your intervention can be either a one-time shot or long-term program that could be of value in addressing the specific need within the community in which you reside. Budget is not necessarily a concern here, so go wild if you like! Grading for this assignment will consider the following:\n\nUnderstanding of the theory/model chosen\nFeasibility of the intervention created based on the theory/model constructs\nLevel of creativity in addressing an identified community issue\n\nTo prepare:\n\nExplain why you chose the particular public health issue within your community. (Examples might be alcohol use reduction for teens at prom, anti-smoking campaigns for construction workers, HIV/AIDS education programs for elementary students, disease prevention and health promotion for seniors at a long-term care facility, or increasing diagnostic testing participation for colonoscopies with middle-class women over 60 years of age.)  \nThe specific topic and target population must be selected from your community and must be a verifiable issue. To be verifiable, it must have been a newspaper story, a health department memo or newsletter, a city proclamation, or any issue for which you can provide actual documentation, to verify, that the issue you chose was one currently or recently occurring in your community. That documentation must be provided with your response.\nChoose a specific theory or model, and explain why you are using this one in creating an intervention to address this public health issue. Your intervention must use the constructs of the theory/model and must be specific to the target group, for that topic, in your community. For example, the Social-Ecological Model (discussed last MOD) is composed of levels, namely interpersonal, intrapersonal, institutional, community, and societal. It is based on the belief that change within the physical and social environments will also influence health behavior within individuals. Consequently, if one chose the SEM as their theory/model, emphasis on the 5 levels would be critical. If, on the other hand, the Social Capital Theory was chosen, it is based on networks and relationships, with the two important factors being trust and reciprocity. So, your intervention most certainly would address cooperation, working together, and building strong bonds for healthy relationships and communities.\n\n\nWrite an 8- to 9-page paper (not including title page and references) that includes the following:\n\nTitle page\nIntroduction of public health issue and target population with documentation and brief explanation\nTheory/model to be employed in addressing issue (explain why you chose this theory/model)\nIdentify the constructs of the theory/model and explain how they apply to your community issue\nAt least one paragraph specifically describing your intervention for each construct\nEvaluation of intervention\nConclusion",":slug19":"opioids-the-community-is-cobb-county-publichealth",":category19":"English homework help",":tag19":"publichealth"},"Total rows count":20,"Total parameters count":120} []

Why is market research so important for a successful marketing campaign? For Thursday's class, what example did you use as a successful social media marketing campaign? Based on this week's lectures, what are several things you would do for a successful marketing campaign in your area of interest? Answer Example: 1. Marketing is how you conduct outreach for your product or service. For this class it can be how you choose to show your music to the general public and the different demographics within it.Market research is important for a successful marketing campaign because you have to know your audience. If you can look at detailed analytics about your following then you can tailor your marketing around them. You can turn casual fans into stans. On the flip side, you can also research what demographics your music doesn’t reach but has potential to be successful in. Market research is about strengthening and growing your fan-base.I used artikque’s tik toks as a successful marketing campaign. Basically, he posted tik toks of popular house DJs reacting to his songs through twitch. I remember he posted one where his song made AC Slater stand out of his seat and start dancing. Being able to garner such a positive response from an established DJ personally made me want to check out his music. Also i think it’s smart Artikque is doing this because the tik tok algorithm seems to align people’s feed with their hobbies. I can safely assume that the majority of people who saw artikque’s tik toks already have a passion for house music. Tik tok connects those people and assists with music discovery that way.If i were to run a marketing campaign I would use tik tok, twitter and instagram. I’d combine all of these platforms with a linktree. On tik tok I would post snippets from live concerts as well as background music for dancing tik toks. On twitter, I’d post EDM related memes and maybe a couple musical hot takes to stir the pot; I’d advertise sparingly on twitter. I’d do the bulk of my ‘overt’ advertising on instagram but still buffer it with concert pics, personal photos, and engaging story polls. I’d constantly be referring to my other social media through links.2. Marketing is the tools that you use to promote your work, product, or service. Market research is important to successful marketing campaigns because it allows you to understand what methods work the best and how many people you are reaching. It can also tell you more about the demographics of the people interacting with your campaign and help you to cater your future efforts to appeal to your target group. For thursdays class I used the example of Spotify Wrapped. This is less of an individual promoting their work and more of the platform promoting itself. Wrapped is basically a pop up sent to users that can be viewed in a similar way as a social media story feature, meaning you tap through it to see every page. It uses information collected within the app about your listening habits, how much time you spend listening to music, which artists you listen to the most, and which genres you listen to the most over the course of the year. It is presented in visually appealing and very organized slides. At the end of the presentation the app asks you to share your stats on other social media platforms such as Instagram or Twitter. In my personal life I can say I see anywhere from 20-30 people posting their Wrapped list on other platforms and I do not really use social media. Up until I used social media I had no idea that the Spotify service provided that every year. I think that this is a good example of successful marketing because it advertises not only their streaming service, but also the way that the service functions. People find it interesting to look at their personal statistics and want to share their results with others. The service also encourages the use of hashtags such as #wrapped2020 or #spotifywrapped to further engage other social media sites with their service. From this week's lecture I have learned that it is in your best interest to vary the types of posts that you are making as well as post on multiple platforms. I would want to utilize apps like Twitter for quick announcements or interactions with other users, but something like Instagram to showcase what I was trying to promote in a more detailed way. I also learned that posting links via social media can be very efficient. I think I would utilize links to send people to either a website that is specific to what I am promoting or to a personal youtube channel.",":slug3":"discussion-questions-article",":category3":"Applied Sciences homework help",":tag3":"ARTICLE",":title4":"Project Part 2 - Stats",":excerpt4":"Competency\nIn this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competency:\n\nApply statistical techniques",":body4":"Competency\nIn this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competency:\n\nApply statistical techniques to address research problems\nPerform hypothesis testing to address an authentic problem\n\nOverview\nIn this project, you will apply inference methods for means to test your hypotheses about the housing sales market for a region of the United States.

The sole purpose of the theory is to comprehend and predict the individual or group behavior and to identify methods by which change or modification can be achieved. The major changes include the promotion of health activities, change in behavior, and improved personality. It is also indicated in the theory that environmental variations, behavior changes, and individual personal factors are the real causes to affect one’s behavior (White et al., 2019). Social cognitive theory is predominantly helpful when collaborated with educational institutions to improve behavior changes like introducing advanced knowledge into practice. Prochaska and DiClementi’s Model of Behavior Change is one of the most beneficial and productive models for health behavior changes.\nStages of Change Theory\nProchaska and DiClementi’s Model of Behavior Change was initially established to target the customers that need a change in health behavior, especially smokers under therapy treatment. There were four stages of this theory at the start, but now it has five different stages along with additional consideration of multiple audiences rather than individual cases. These stages of change theory are as follows: Precontemplation refers to the condition in which an individual does not understand and unaware consciously or unconsciously of the fact that change is a necessity for him/her. Contemplation indicates the situation of the person who is well aware of the problem and started to think about changing his or her attitude. Preparation for action indicates whenever the individual is ready to accept the challenge to change the attitude and start preparing to change is considered as “the act of preparation.” This stage may be clear within 02 weeks after making the decision to change. The action starts with the engagement of an individual into the change activities and understands how to cope with the behavioral change. Maintenance is considered as the final stage, which varies with individuals, but normally it may take up to six months. Any change in behavior must be strengthened in order to sustain the change.\nAppraisal of evidence\nThere is a lot of evidence that proved that this model or theory could create a difference in the health behavior of an individual. Prochaska, DiClemente, and Norcross defined ten procedures that can evaluate and inspire the movement across the stages, which include Re-evaluation of environmental activities, Individual self-freedom, Social freedom, Sense of dramatic relief, Awareness levitation, Re-evaluation of self-esteem, Improvement in the relationships, Strengthening of management, Incitement control and Counter conditioning.  These are some of the processes that can be achieved through this model or theory. The evidence depicted that this model is quite promising in the counseling of the patients who have HIV (AIDS) and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). It has also been reported as the supplement for improving the efficacy and implementation of interventions intended to minimize a load of musculoskeletal wounds (Rothmore, Aylward, & Karnon, 2015; Oakman et al., 2016). There are some shortcomings in every designed model, and still, some space is always available to improve things. Similarly, this model did not address the two key elements, i.e., the impact of environment and structure on behavioral health changes, which are necessary for planning a translation of new information into a practice setting.\nNetworking with the stakeholders\nStakeholders are the crucial and key element of this model because they can help an individual to improve his or her behavior in a complex environment. They mostly identify those people who will be a part of the change, affected by the change, and persuasive in the change process. Apart from this, they are responsible for investigating the character of all stakeholders, their commitment, affective for or against the change (Rothmore et al., 2016). Teamwork is also an additional supplement for the accomplishment of any change. Therefore, understanding the stakeholders or their role in the rehabilitation process is the most essential part of this model.  \nIdentifying and addressing barriers to implementation\nTranslation project or any change model has so many external barriers and facilitators to devalue the whole process. It is very necessary to identify and address those barriers for the improvement of the model or theory. Both the challenges and barriers can be broken down by considering some basic elements like adopter behavior, organizational structure, innovative ideas, and improve communication. This model also identified and addressed the barriers and challenges that occurred during the transitional phase of individual health activities.\nReferences\nWhite, K.

An important stage in the model is that of relapse.  It changes the model from being linear to one that is cyclical.    The provider must be able to assess the stage of change and facilitate movement through each of the stages.",":slug5":"change-models-assignment-help",":category5":"Nursing homework help",":tag5":"Assignment help",":title6":"Application 2 - please",":excerpt6":"For this weeks application, watch the Crash Course video on Pregnancy and Development (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B",":body6":"For this weeks application, watch the Crash Course video on Pregnancy and Development (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtsSbZ85yiQ).

Many times, it will be important to show empathy to our clients and not get it confused with sympathy. We can carefully listen to the client to help us understand their needs. We currently give a personality test and have classes that are geared to learning our personality and styles of communication. This is helpful, as I learned I have a personality that likes to take care of people. Certain ethical situations were presented in the reading material such as buying clients food. I understand how the CHW felt, yet also know that learning how to communicate based on your personality style is important. We constantly have situations where applicants need rides to the front gate, but we cannot provide transportation in our personal vehicles. We either call the recruiter to have them fix the issue or we will have to drive to the gate alone to sponsor their ride onto base. Then walk the applicant out and follow them back off base to make sure they left. As much as a nuisance as this it, especially when we are extremely busy, it is important to follow the guidelines.

This discussion covers a QI initiative of the actualization of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program amongst patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery with corresponding measurement and assessment of change in care outcomes.\nPrecisely, the QI initiative involved here consists of elective cesarean delivery patients over two 12-month periods before and after implementation of the initiative and the measurement criterion is based on the measurement of the opioid exposure of the patient. Each of the 12-month observation period involve 4689 and 4624 patients respectively, spread across 15 hospitals (Hedderson et al., 2019). The specific outcome improvement measurement tenets included an improvement on the management of pain after the surgery, early capability to move, good nutrition and enhanced engagement with patients. As expected, the results of the study indicate a reduction in morphine equivalents which can be interpreted as reduced morphine use, an improvement in the management of pain, improved nutrition and increase in number of patients showcasing stable mobility earlier.\nAdditional measures of assessment for the study included observation of period of hospital stay, readmission rates, breastfeeding statistics and infections contracted at surgical sites. Improvement observed based on such measures indicates the functionality of the QI initiative implemented (Kathy & Janice, 2016). Overall, the observation that opioid use is controllable without a negative effect of the initiative on after surgery pain management reinforces the purpose of a QI initiative.\nReferences\nHedderson, M., Lee, D., Hunt, E., Lee, K., Xu, F., & Mustille, A. et al.

Students can identify a usable market segment to be a target market and determine an appropriate target-market strategy\nPositioning.  Students can develop and interpret a perceptual map.\n\nDirections\n\nRefer to the product or service you selected for your first writing assignment. This week, you want to take a closer look at what consumer factors may be relevant for customers who are considering buying your product or service offering.  This will require some critical thinking on your part based on your own behavior if you are a customer yourself, or you may want to talk to others who have purchased the product.  Sometimes you can find clues when looking at the marketing messages that may be addressing some of these factors. \nSo far, you have only been considering the customers of your product or service as one big group, or a mass market.  More astute marketing breaks down this large group into smaller market segments of consumers who have similar characteristics.  For any specific product or service, there could be numerous market segments.  However, company resources may only allow a company to pursue one or two or these market segments, which then become target market(s).  In this paper, you should divide the mass market for your product or service into at least two market segments and then pick one target market you think would have the most potential for future growth.  \nChances are you picked a product with which you are familiar. That is a good starting point, and you may represent one target market.  But you may represent a target market that is saturated and therefore not the best target market to pick for the remainder of the semester.  So be sure your second target market is different enough and represents growth potential. \nIf you did not do a thorough analysis of the competition in the prior writing assignment, you may need to go back and figure out the nature of the product's or service’s competition.  This will be important when you address the positioning of your product for your newly identified target market inasmuch as positioning is a competition-based concept.  \n\nPart 1\n\nConsumer decision-making process.  Go through the six steps of the purchase process outlined in the readings and identify where marketing can influence each of the six steps.   For example, if a consumer just identified a need for your product in step one, then the company can advertise how your product fills that need.  Or, if a consumer purchased your product, the consumer can be called and asked about their satisfaction with the product and if there is any dissatisfaction steps can be taken to ensure the customer satisfaction.  Be sure to be more specific with respect to your product or service than this example.\nSegmentation.  View Table 5.1 of your Week 4 Reading, in Section 5.2, How Markets are Segmented.  Using the various criteria of the segmentation bases described in Table 5.1, identify at least two distinct market segments for your product or service.  Each market segment description must include at least three (more if needed) of the characteristics from amongst any of the four bases categories (e.g. one from demographic variables, one or two from psychographic variables, and one from behavioral variables, or a similar scheme).  Be sure to explain your choices based on what customer need the product or service offering can fill for each segment. \n\nPart 2\n\nTarget market & strategy.  Select one of the market segments you described in your segmentation response as the one you believe is or can be the most profitable for your product or service offering and explain why you feel they can represent growth for the company.  Refer to the six criteria for an attractive market segment as described in Section 5.3 of the reading ‘Selecting Target Markets’.  Name your target market so you can use this name throughout all of your remaining writing assignments.  Your name should be descriptive of the segments' characteristics like 'savvy young shoppers' or 'educated baby boomers', or 'urban hipsters', or the like.  The goal is for your faculty member to get a mental image of your target market for the remainder of the semester. Should the company focus all their resources on this new target market (concentrated marketing) or should they continue to pursue both the new and the existing target market as well as other market segments (multi-segment marketing)?  Alternatively, is the market so saturated might they be more successful by focusing solely on an even more narrow market segment, perhaps an even narrower version (niche marketing) of your selected target market, as their best chance for growth?  What is your reasoning?\nPositioning.  Draw a perceptual map as illustrated in the week's readings or the website in the directions. Be sure to pick two criteria that are important to your new target market for your two axes, perhaps two of the criteria you used in Week 1 in your competitive analysis.  Map at least the two major competitors you noted in the previous writing assignment and add any others that you may have discovered since then.  You may want to visit this resource for more information on how to construct a perceptual map.  Describe what the perceptual map is telling you regarding how each product is perceived in the minds of the new target market you described above.  You may have to make a series of educated guesses for some of the data points.  Ideally, you want to find uncontested space. If your product overlaps with a competing offering discuss whether or not your product or service should try for an ‘uncontested’ space on the map and ‘reposition’ itself; or if it should keep the same position and compete head on with the other product.  \n\nReadings:\n Consumer Behavior: How people make buying decisions.

Using the Analysis menu in SPSS, go to Compare Means, Go to the Paired Sample t-test. Add the BaselineWeight and InterventionWeight in the Pair 1 fields. Click OK. Report the mean weights, standard deviations, t-statistic, degrees of freedom, and p level. Report as t(df)=value, p = value. Report the p level out three digits.\nINDEPENDENT SAMPLE T-TEST: Identify the variables InterventionGroups and PatientWeight. Go to the Analysis Menu, go to Compare Means, Go to Independent Samples tT-test. Add InterventionGroups to the Grouping Factor. Define the groups according to codings in the variable view (1=Intervention, 2 =Baseline). Add PatientWeight to the test variable field. Click OK. Report the mean weights, standard deviations, t-statistic, degrees of freedom, and p level. Report t(df)=value, p = value. Report the p level out three digits\nCHI-SQUARE (Independent): Identify the variables BaselineReadmission and InterventionReadmission. Go to the Analysis Menu, go to Descriptive Statistics, go to Crosstabs. Add BaselineReadmission to the row and InterventionReadmission to the column. Click the Statistics button and choose Chi-Square. Select eta to report the Effect Size. Click suppress tables. Click OK. Report the frequencies of the total events, the chi-square statistic, degrees of freedom, and p level. Report ꭓ2 (df) =value, p =value. Report the p level out three digits.\nMCNEMAR (Paired): Identify the variables BaselineCompliance and InterventionCompliance. Go to the Analysis Menu, go to Descriptive Statistics, go to Crosstabs. Add BaselineCompliance to the row and InterventionCompliance to the column. Click the Statistics button and choose Chi-Square and McNemars. Select eta to report the Effect Size. Click suppress tables. Click OK. Report the frequencies of the events, the Chi-square, and the McNemar’s p level. Report (p =value). Report the p level out three digits.\nMANN WHITNEY U: Identify the variables InterventionGroups and PatientSatisfaction. Using the Analysis Menu, go to Non-parametric Statistics, go to LegacyDialogs, go to 2 Independent samples. Add InterventionGroups to the Grouping Variable and PatientSatisfaction to the Test Variable. Check Mann Whitney U. Click OK. Report the Medians or Means, the Mann Whitney U statistic, and the p level. Report (U =value, p =value). Report the p level out three digits.\nWILCOXON Z: Identify the variables BaselineWeight and InterventionWeight. Go to the Analysis Menu, go to Non-parametric Statistics, go to LegacyDialogs, go to 2 Related samples. Add the BaselineWeight and InterventionWeight in the Pair 1 fields. Click OK. Report the Mean or Median weights, standard deviations, Z-statistic, and p level. Report as (Z =value, p =value). Report the p level out three digits.\n\nInclude the following in your paper:\n\nDiscussion of the types of statistical tests used and why they have been chosen.\nDiscussion of the differences between parametric and non-parametric tests.\nDescription of the reported results of the statistical tests above.\nSummary of the conclusive result of the data analyses.\nOutputs from the statistical analysis provided as an Appendix to the paper.\nComparison table of the variable's level of measurement provided as an Appendix to the paper.\n\nUse the following guidelines to report the test results:\n\nStatistically Significant Difference: When reporting exact p values, state early in the data analysis and results section, the alpha level used for the significance criterion for all tests in the project. Example: An alpha or significance level of < .05 was used for all statistical tests in the project. Then if the p-level is less than this value identified, the result is considered statistically significant. A statistically significant difference was noted between the scores before compared to after the intervention t(24) = 2.37, p = .007. \nMarginally Significant Difference: If the results are found in the predicted direction but are not statistically significant, indicate that results were marginally significant. Example: Scores indicated a marginally significant preference for the intervention group (M = 3.54, SD = 1.20) compared to the baseline (M = 3.10, SD = .90), t(24) = 1.37, p = .07. Or there was a marginal difference in readmissions before (15) compared to after (10) the intervention ꭓ2(1) = 4.75, p = .06.\nNon-Significant Trend: If the p-value is over .10, report results revealed a non-significant trend in the predicted direction. Example: Results indicated a non-significant trend for the intervention group (14) over the baseline (12), ꭓ2(1) = 1.75, p = .26.\n\nThe results of the inferential analysis are used for decision-making and not hypothesis testing. It is important to look at the real results and establish what criterion is necessary for further implementation of the project's findings. These conclusions are a start.\nPortfolio Practice Hours:\nPractice immersion assignments are based on your current course objectives and is application-based learning using your real-world practice setting. These assignments earn practice immersion hours and are indicated in the syllabus by a Portfolio Practice Hours statement, which reminds you, the learner, to enter in a corresponding case log in Typhon. Actual practice immersion hours are entered, but the average hours associated with each practice immersion assignment is 10.\nYou are required to complete your assignment using a real-world application. Real-world application requires the use of evidence-based data, contemporary theories, and concepts presented in the course. The culmination of your assignment must present a viable application in a current practice setting. For more information on parameters for practice immersion hours, please refer to DNP resources in the DC Network.\nTo earn portfolio practice hours, enter the following after the references section of your paper:\nPractice Hours Completion Statement DNP-830\nI, (INSERT NAME), verify that I have completed (NUMBER OF) practice immersion hours in association with the goals and objectives for this assignment. I have also tracked said practice immersion hours in the Typhon Student Tracking System for verification purposes and will be sure that all approvals are in place from my faculty and practice mentor.",":slug14":"what-are-the-data-saying-dnp",":category14":"Nursing homework help",":tag14":"DNP",":title15":"Marketing (MKT3151.E1) Digital Marketing (Part 2), Assignment 6 - easy",":excerpt15":"Question 1\n· Choose a product or service (it can be anything from running shoes, a garden tool, cosmetic, car, etc.).\n�",":body15":"Question 1\n· Choose a product or service (it can be anything from running shoes, a garden tool, cosmetic, car, etc.).\n· Identify 3 companies that sell your selected product/service and “digitally explore” each as it relates to your selected product/service.

In regards to which level, the state level s",":body10":"respond to their discussion answers\nThe government should provide services. In regards to which level, the state level should be providing services to its inhabitants, but that is not to let the federal government off the hook. The local governments are essentially to small to provide, and they are usually reliable on the state government for services and resources. The federal government shouldn't possess all the services. \"Without adequate and independent financial resources, or some guarantee of adequate resources at each level of government, the federal structure will not operate as a truly federal structure. (76) However, if the state is struggling with funds, the federal government can, and should, provide for the states.\nI believe both the states and citizens should pay for services rendered, depending on the service. I say depending on the service, because most \"are the responsibility of state and local governments.\" (79) At the very least, the states should make it to where everyone has the ability to pay, and that is by paying as well. Services that are more of a concern in certain areas, such as Trump's Wall, should tax those in that area. This can get unfair, however. A fraction of individuals in the specific area might not be a fan or supporter of the wall. If possible, the pro-wall individuals can pay for those services, but it is probably best left to the states with assistance of the federal level.  There are services that should be held as a \"right of civilization.\" The constitution is all about emphasizing equality. That includes services, regardless of a level's financial status. Police, firefighters, law, and health services should be available to all. \nAll services should not be privatized, that includes the military. Privatization is often the go to because more money is going in the pocket of the government. \"Governments at all levels are just desperate to balance their budgets, and they're grasping at privatization as a panacea.\" (Kim, 2010) This is incredibly risky. Governments are playing risk vs. reward. \"You're taking the risk of the unknown and dumping that on your supplier.\" (Kim, 2010) Governments are inviting corruption when privatizing.  \"Problems from poorly conceived contracts can create costs increases that far surpass the costs of in-house services, and if there's shoddy contract oversight, a government is vulnerable to corruption and profiteering.\" (Kim, 2010) The ultimate risk is that privatization can put governments into deeper debt. \nI believe the federal government should have the power to require states and localities to provide services for individuals. To repeat the idea in my first paragraph, I say this to maintain a balanced level of authority and power. Without that, we truly don't act as a federalist system. Ultimately, the federal level maintains the upmost authority, but should not be to the point where we are running a federal level dominant system.\nStephens, G. R., & Wikstrom, N. (2007).

Should different levels of government rely on others to provide funding for those services? \nYes, I believe the government should provide services, but the bigger question is, should it be more of the federal or state’s responsibility?  To me, that is the main issue here.  In reading Ch.4, it gives a detailed history of the federal government “loosening the reins” of some powers and giving the responsibility to the states; especially after World War II.  Before this, state governments relied heavily on the federal government and taxes on property as well.  That all changed after the war was over and kept changing from there on forward with each different President who took office.  Therefore, I believe the states should provide services such as water sanitation, but the federal government should provide the funding for the mandates and quality control and staff to monitor.\n2. Who should pay for services rendered? Should all citizens pay equally, regardless of ability to pay? Are there services that should be considered a \"right of civilization\", available to all regardless of income level? What about costs for issues that are of more concern to citizens in some geographic areas than others - Trump's \"wall\", for example, or cleanup of the Gulf of Mexico from the BP Deepwater spill? \nRegarding services rendered, that discussion can be a slippery slope and I can see the arguments on opposing sides of this topic.  In thinking about this I would lean more toward it should be divided equally amongst its citizens.  There are services I would consider to be “rights of civilization” and should be available to everyone, regardless of income status in their communities.  For example, social services, social benefits, emergency social assistance is managed and organized per their local government.  These services should be available to all in the community, even if they have no income.  Other examples of “right of civilization” would be clean water supply, police, and fire department services, etc.  Issues that are more geographic in nature should be a combination of a federal and state venture in my opinion. \n3. Should all services be privatized? The military? Essential utilities such as water or sewer? How should we decide what should or should not be.\nI do think in some instances it is good for services to be privatized and history has shown that it has helped the overall bottom lines of some state’s economies.  Privatization of public services is nothing new, it has been happening at all levels of government.  The main arguments to privatize services are cost reduction, the transfer of risk and liability, create a sour4ce of revenue, and achieving a higher level of quality service.  Examples of privatized services include airport operations, waste collection facilities’, corrections, and lotteries.  So, all in all I believe some services should be privatized as I see the advantages to it but in other cases, such as the military, I do not believe that it should be privatized.  I feel in that case, the cons would outweigh the pros.\n4. Should the federal government have the power to require states/localities to provide services, or require those services directly upon the individual?\nI believe that the federal government should have the power to require states provide services for their citizens, especially for those services essential to keep an area civilized and safe as possible.  Essential services should be required and available to all.  I do not believe the federal government should take over or have absolute power, but they must work with the states and come up with a joint solution or put mandates in place. \nWorks Cited:\nStephens, G.

There are two sections!\nSection 1: Probability theory: Expected Value and Lotteries (ONE QUESTION TOTAL)\nWe discussed how the sample mean can be skewed by an extreme value. In a sample of 100 people from Texas, if a multi-millionaire oil baron is randomly chosen for the sample, the mean income in the sample would be skewed higher than the median.\nThe sample mean is sometimes referred to as the expected value, written E[X] for the expected value of X. In probability theory the expected value is the sum of all potential outcomes, weighted by the probability/chance of the occurrence. For example, assume you are close friends with the oil baron. You need money for school, and as your friend he will agrees to give you one of two cars he never drives, which you will immediately sell for cash. He will flip a coin to determine which one, giving you a 50/50 chance of each. Let’s say one car is worth $12,000 and the other car is worth $118,000. The expected value is written E[X] = 0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $118,000 = $65,000. Notice that this is also the average of the two values.\n\nQuestion 1: Consider a random lottery, where 2,250 people enter their name (only once per-person) and a machine selects one winner at random. Each player has an equal chance of selection and the winning prize is $425,000.\na.\tAbsent any costs associated with winning or playing the lottery, what is the expected value of entering the lottery one time?\nb.\tAssume the winner must pay a 20% tax on lottery winnings. Further, the dealer wants to charge an entry fee. Exactly 2,250 people believe in luck and will play if the expected value of the gamble is greater than or equal to zero. What is the maximum entry fee the dealer can charge? Will the dealer make a profit? \nc.\tWhat is the fundamental difference between the typical Powerball or Megamillions lottery and the one we established in our example above? Use two sentences or less to explain.\n\n\nSection 2: Stata Exercises (FIVE QUESTIONS TOTAL)\nFor this section you will download data from this site: https://www.stata.com/texts/eacsap/\nConnect to the virtual Stata console here: https://vcon.lib.uh.edu/portal/webclient/index.html#/ \n-\tFind the data “labsup.dta” which contains variables for birthing mothers and their background characteristics. Save the file to your computer in a folder you can track down.\n-\tBoot up StataSE 15 by clicking on the icon .  \n\n\n\n(File Transfer)\n-\tUpload the labsup.dta file to your virtual desktop using file transfer. Open the tab on the far left side of the console and select the file transfer option (circled in red in the screenshot). Your file will be stored in the virtual “documents” folder. You will also use this tab to toggle between open files (circled in blue).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\tStata allows us to write programs, so our work is reproducible. We save the program codes as .do file format, which is Stata specific but other statistical software have the same functionality. Once Stata is up and running, click the icon to open a new .do file. Of the two with a pencil, it is the one on the left.\n\n-\t Before proceeding, save your .do to the documents folder. In the .do file pane, click “file…save as…”, select desktop, then your user folder, then documents folder.  While you have the window open, save the filepath by right clicking on “Documents” at the top and selecting “Copy address as text.”\n \n\n-\tNavigate back to your .do file. The first step is to set the working directory using the cd (change directory) command. We will use the documents folder as the directory. Next, load the dataset with the use command. In this example I clear the temporary memory, set the working directory, and load the data. Select the block you wish to execute and press the “do” button.\n \n\nBy this point you will see the data loaded up in the main Stata panel. That’s the way it works. You code up something in the .do file and it is executed in the workstation. \n\nOther than the .do file you can tell Stata to execute something by typing directly into the command line in the main Stata panel.  Note that for any Stata function you can use help followed by the command name, directly into the command line. Also note that to see the data table, type browse into the command line and press enter.\n  \n\n1.\tThe labsup dataset contains variables describing the fertility of n=31,857 mothers. Summarize the variable “kidcount” in detail and answer the following questions.\na.\tDescribe the sample based on the number of kids. Are there any women in the sample with no children? Use three sentences or less.\nb.\tLet’s say a big family is one that has three kids or more. Based on this definition, what fraction of the total sample has a big family? Use the count function.\nc.\tIf I were to randomly select a mother from this sample, what is the probability that I would choose a woman with 5 kids or more? What about 3 kids or less?\n\n2.\tRandom variables can be categorized as discrete or continuous. A discrete variable is one that has values determined by counts: the number of kids, total family size, etc. A continuous variable is measured and can take on fractional values: income, miles, square footage of a house are a few examples. \na.\tBased on your summary output in #1, is the median or mean a better descriptor for the number of kids each mother has? Why?\nb.\tThere are three income variables in the dataset. Use the kdensity function to plot the probability density for “labinc” (mom’s labor income in 000’s). Also summarize “labinc.” What is informative from looking at the probability density that you might not have picked up just by looking at the mean? Paste a screenshot of your density here as well.\nc.\tNow plot the probability density for “faminc” (total household income). Does this variable approximate a normal distribution? Are there observations in the data you might flag as erroneous?\n\n3.\tUse the correlation command to create a single correlation matrix for the following variables: agefstm (mother’s age at first birth), kidcount, faminc, and educ (years of education). \na.\tPaste a screenshot of your correlation matrix here.\nb.\tSome of the correlations are obvious, for example years of education is positively correlated with income. Identify one positive and one negative correlation that would have been less obvious before running this correlation.\nc.\tA researcher looks at the correlation between family income and kidcount and notices that the sign is negative. She then says to herself, “wow, lower income families have more kids. This is surprising given they would have less resources than a richer family.” Think like an economist- given the correlation between family income, years of education, and mother’s age at first birth, what might be an alternative explanation for why lower income mothers have more children? Use four sentences or less.\n\n4.\tIndeed, the correlation between family income and number of kids is not very strong. Let’s run a regression to test for the effect of increasing income on the number of kids. Using the regress command, run the following regression equations.\na.\tFirst run the regression \n \nwhere Yi is kidscount, and X1i is faminc (family income). What is the coefficient for B1?\nb.\tNow run the regression \n \nWhere X2i is years of education and X3i is mom’s age at first birth.  Does the coefficient B1 become smaller or larger?\nc.\tNow run the regression\n \nWhere Zi is labinc (mom’s labor income). Which coefficient is larger, the coefficient for family income (B1) or the coefficient for mom’s income (B4)? Also paste a screenshot of your regression results for part c (only) here.\n\n5.\tIn the 1980’s the FDA approved oral contraceptives commonly referred to as birth control pills. Think like an economist – what is the opportunity cost of childbirth for a woman of working age? What effect do you think birth control pills had on college graduation rates of women since the approval? Given what you found in the prior steps, what is one mechanism in which birth control pills might decrease the fertility rate in the United States, outside of directly preventing contraception?

He has completed a strategic review that has convinced him that the division needs to undergo rapid and substantial change in a number of areas, given the recent strategic moves of key competitors. Although Jack is new, he is familiar enough with the company to know that there will be significant resistance to the changes from a number of quarters. He also suspects that some of this resistance will come from people with the capacity to act in ways that could seriously impede successful change. Jack reflects on the situation. He believes that it is important to introduce the proposed changes soon, but he also recognizes that if he acts too quickly, he’ll have virtually no time to have a dialogue with staff about the proposed changes, much less involve them in any significant way. One option is to act speedily and to make it clear that “consequences” will follow for anyone not cooperating. He certainly has the power to act on such a threat.\nThe risk, Jack knows, is that even if no one shows outright resistance, there’s a big difference between not cooperating and acting in a manner that reflects commitment. He knows that he needs the cooperation of key groups of staff and that sometimes “minimum-level compliance” can be as unhelpful as resistance when it comes to implementing change. “But maybe I’m exaggerating this problem,” he thinks to himself. “Maybe I should just go ahead with the change. If people don’t like it, they can leave. If they stay, they’ll come around.” But Jack is not sure. He considers another option. Maybe he should spend more time on building up support at least among key groups of managers and staff, if not more broadly across the organization. “Maybe,” he reflects, “the need to change is not quite as immediate as I think. I just know that I’d feel a whole lot better if this consultation could happen quickly.”\nYour Task Jack respects your opinion on business matters and has asked you for your views on his situation.\n· What would be your recommendation?\n· What factors should Jack take into account in deciding what course of action to take?",":slug10":"case-study-information-systems-homework-help-case-study-7",":category10":"Information Systems homework help",":tag10":"case study",":title11":"Topic - Post",":excerpt11":"300 words \nAPA format \n1-2 references\n\nTraining and development (T&D) are unavoidable strategic issues due to rapid sh",":body11":"300 words \nAPA format \n1-2 references\n\nTraining and development (T&D) are unavoidable strategic issues due to rapid shifts in technology that result in premature obsolescence.

Planning and organizing is they two I use most. Planning helps to determine which steps are necessary to implement goals and what resources are needed. I use this when compiling my workload and determining items needed to complete the job. I also tend to categorize long term assignment and short-term assignments. Organizing goes hand in hand with planning. It is generally the process by which the plans are moved closer to realization. When I organize my plans, I start by prioritizing important keynote items as well as assignments that need a quick return. When it comes to leading the focus is on managing people such as individual employees, teams and groups rather than tasks. I plan on focusing on my groups personal strengths in order to achieve optimal greatness. In this case I would be open to the second perspective on marketing. Controlling process of evaluating the execution of the plan and making adjustments to ensure that the organizational goal is achieved. Overseeing is how I would describe this. \n\nAdam post\n \nThe four steps are planning, organizing ,leading and controlling. In these key factor's though they are all important in being successful, I find planning is the most important. This to me is the foundation in which all your work is based on. Without proper planning the three following will fail. In my daily routine as a supervisor I come in an hour early and plan for the next twelve hours. I try to work out all the what if's and what might be. If planned right it makes my job so much easier for the next three stages. If i miss or fail at my planning for the day, I feel like I'm chasing myself and wondering where the time has went. Somewhere in there controlling takes affect on all that you do as well. The worst feeling as being a supervisor is when you loose control of the plant. Once gone it seems like it spreads like wild fire, everyone forgets what there doing, sometimes I wonder how they even tie their shoes in the morning. But being under control and putting one fire out at a time makes it all the easier to put things back into place. Doing this is by using your leadership skills and organization.\n\n \nIn response to Caitlin, comment on facts about the normal distribution Caitlin have posted, supporting your response by explaining why it captures your interest or describing how the principle can be applied in psychology and/or everyday life.\nCaitlin post\n \nWhile reading this week's chapter, what stood out to be is the 68-97-99.7 rule. I think it is interesting how rarely the standard deviation will be within 4. When looking at the visual of this charts with the \"bell\" shape, it actually reminded me of charts we have seen recently with the current COVID pandemic. I kept hearing the term \"flattening the curve\" in reference to slowing down the spread of this virus. While researching a connection between the COVID virus data and normal distribution, I came across an article on path.org that states that \"daily deaths per population will follow a normal distribution (a bell curve) which they fit to mortality data and social distance data from each state in the United States. This type of model can help estimate the timing and magnitude of the peak to support hospital provision planning\" (Volbrecht & Slater, 2020). Unfortunately, with the growing number of cases, the virus spread no longer seems to be following normal distribution, but hopefully now with the production of a vaccine, we will start to see the numbers go down.",":slug10":"for-anyone-psychology-homework-help-assignment-help-14",":category10":"Psychology homework help",":tag10":"Assignment help",":title11":"Due Sunday by 3pm - Assignment help",":excerpt11":"For this week's reflection journal entry, reflect on what you have learned in this module about evaluating progress, coo",":body11":"For this week's reflection journal entry, reflect on what you have learned in this module about evaluating progress, coordinating resources and services, and strategies for teaching clients to use these resources to meet their goals.

Budgets need to be organized, figures need to align and be easy to read (Kramer, 2019). Many companies use budgets to keep their funds in order.\nDescribe how you might alter the budget after the grant ended or which budget items you would prioritize as you sought additional funding to continue the program.\nAs a professional I would alter the grant after it ended by seeing how much the grant brought into the company and estimate how much. If it did not bring much money then I would look at researching and redoing the proposal. Looking at the budget plans and seeing which ones did not benefit would allow the company to see where and what they need to change.\nExplain why you would make these changes or prioritize specific budget items. Finally, explain how you would fundraise to meet the budget priorities.\nMaking changes allows for other opportunities to be planned and other questions to be asked about the previous budget. The company can do different things to fundraise for the budget such as sale things. The company can also fundraise by getting with other companies and seeing what they do to bring in money to the company.\nReferences\nKramer, H. (2019). How to prepare a grant proposal budget for a nonprofit. https://www.thebalancesmb.com/the-basics-of-preparing-a-budget-for-a-grant-proposal-2501952\nPeer 2\nBellinda Mack \nRE: Discussion 2 - Week 9\nThe grant proposal I selected is for 1,000 to 10,000 dollars to aid the Kennett Area Senior Program. The agency shows they are able to maintain a healthy budget and reports being \"in the black\" for the fourth time in 20 years (O' Connor, 2015). However, they require new funding because the economic downturn and reallocation of funding to other programs has made it more difficult for them to provide quality services (O' Connor, 2015). Having enough funding in the short term can mean the agency can ride out these economic setbacks and maintain long-term stability (Bowman, 2011). \nThe agency already does fundraising through a bookstore and nearly half of its budget comes from charitable donations (O'Connor, 2015). They allocate approximately 2% of their budget to fundraising (O'Connor, 2015). After the grant period ends, the company will no longer have the additional money for services and considering they are asking for the money so their patrons do not have to use their modest, fixed incomes to participate, it would be important to figure out how to make up the difference after implementation. Since the agency is focused on helping senior citizens engage in the community and live a healthy and fulfilling life, maybe they could fundraise by planning community events involving the seniors. For example, a dinner theater. The seniors could get some time to do something they enjoy and the community could come to support the senior center by purchasing tickets and getting a nice meal. Maybe engaging some of the local restaurants to cater could draw a larger crowd and everyone could have an enjoyable evening. Having agency leadership emcee events like this could help make the community more aware of the services and benefits the agency provides to the community. Also, I know many senior centers offer arts and craft type classes. Perhaps some of the work done in those classes could be auctioned off. I could see the event being set up like a fancy art gallery with a silent auction. The seniors who created the art would have an opportunity to engage with the greater community and talk about their projects, the agency would get exposure, and the community could see how much the center offers to the residents that access it. Both of these events are relatively low cost as they are using money already being spent for supplies and could be hosted in the senior center or other community building. The agency should be able to secure donations from other community businesses or could get sponsors by offering advertisements during the event. \nReferences: \nBowman, W. (2011).

The attacks had immediate and long term economic impacts, some of which continues up to date. People who were exposed to this trauma continue to suffer from related physical and mental health conditions. This is primarily because 9/11 events brought a new era of media coverage of collective traumas transmitting violence into the daily lives of people. Since then, there has been increased physical and mental health, like increased risk of heart diseases after these attacks.\nSimilarly, these attacks ushered in new policies such as the “Patriot Act” that puts more priority on national security and defense at the cost of civil liberties. The American troops continue into the longest-running war in the U.S history in the Middle East, which has seen the defense budget sky-rocketing at the expense of the tax payer’s money.\nA story is newsworthy because of its impact. The events that have more effects on the audience, and those that have actual consequences for the readers’ lives, are exciting. For instance, this story is newsworthy because the 9/11 terrorist attacks have continued affecting people in different capacities up to date. With this impact being more prominent, it makes this story a big one.

During her 60-day review, Suzan’s performance was deemed as acceptable, but her ability to communicate with her colleagues was lacking. During Suzan’s 90-day review, Suzan’s supervisor, at the time, expressed that her performance needed serious improvements. Unfortunately, Suzan’s supervisor noted the following:\n\nSuzan      did not provide her colleagues with messages from customers and vendors.\nSuzan’s      phone skills were ineffective, especially when interacting with customers.\nSuzan’s      temper was a concern and she often raised her voice when she became      frustrated.\n\nYou have been hired to replace Suzan’s previous supervisor. Between Suzan’s 90-day review and presently (her annual review), you have noticed that Suzan’s performance still is a problem. Before her departure from the organization, Suzan’s past supervisor stated, “Suzan is nice; however, she is a horrible communicator. I cannot work with her, as she is such a challenge to deal with… Good luck, as Suzan is one of the worst employees of Organization ABC.”\nDuring your first week in your new role as supervisor, you met with Suzan to understand more about her performance. She stated, “I am a hard worker; however, I only was told what I was doing wrong. I am willing to learn. Can you help me become the best employee for Organization ABC? I want to succeed in this role.”\nAs a supervisor, you know that you have various responsibilities. One of your responsibilities is to address performance deficiencies. Although Suzan was provided with a job description, which included detailed information about the critical nature of communication in her role, she needs additional support.\nExamine pages 79 and 80 in your textbook. Then, create a plan, specific to Suzan’s needs, detailing how you will utilize the following to ensure improved performance:\n\nObservation      and documentation\nUpdates\nFeedback\nResources\nReinforcement\n\nFor example, when thinking about observation and documentation, what might you do to keep track of Suzan’s performance?

End of life discussions are always tough conversations to have. This was considered an ethical issue to me because at the beginning, the patient stated he wanted to do whatever he could do in order to prolong his life expectancy and the NP was in a way, coercing him to make the decision to transition from his home to a hospice center. Though the patient was bed bound, he was still coherent and should be able to make his own decisions without the encouragement of others to do otherwise. If I was the NP in this scenario, I would allow the patient and his mother to come to the decision at their own timing. I would still provide honest, realistic answers, but still give them the opportunity and time to make their own decision. Ethics within healthcare are important because workers must recognize healthcare dilemmas, make good judgments and decisions based on their values while keeping within the laws that govern them (Haddad, 2020). A mechanism to overcome this ethical dilemma would be to just take in account each patient scenario and continue to gain experience in this realm. Learning ways to navigate through these types of scenarios would make it more comfortable for the patient and the provider. \nThe NP in the documentary is noted as a disruptive innovator because she provides primary care to patients in their own homes. Traditional visits to a primary care clinic are often wrought with friction-inducing barriers such as scheduling, commutes, and long wait times for a condensed provider visit that carries a high price tag. Now, health care consumers can have their provider visit them for their primary care needs in the comforts of their own homes where they will experience primary care in a very different way (Fuller, 2019). The need for primary care providers is at an all time high with the population across the nation increasing and primary care physicians not being available, makes a need for NP's to provide the primary care for these patients in an affordable fashion. \nReferences: \nFuller, Ryan MSN, RN, CNML; Hansen, April MSN, RN Disruption Ahead, Nursing Administration Quarterly: July/September 2019 - Volume 43 - Issue 3 - p 212-221 doi: 10.1097/NAQ.0000000000000354\nHaddad LM, Geiger RA. Nursing Ethical Considerations. [Updated 2020 Sep 1]. In: StatPearls [Internet].

In the documentary The Invisible Patients, Jessica, NP goes to four homebound patients and provides them with care. \"Changes to medical models are generally regarded with reticence, but we have been proving our worth by silently meeting the health care needs of underserved populations or special medically complex patients for decades. Disruptive innovation in nursing does not happen overnight or without a strategy, but it does happen, and it is powerful\" (Journal of Pediatric Surgical Nursing, 2016). Jessica goes above and beyond to bridge disparities for these patients. \nJessica faces an ethical dilemma when Ron's brother, Louie, ask her for a prescription. The brothers clearly do not have a lot of resources. It unlikely they have a vehicle or other supporting family members. She could have possibly written Louie a prescription just to help him out. Jessica chose to have the honest response of she can only do that for her established patients. \"The first theme encountered in many ethical dilemmas is the erosion of open and honest communication. The erosion begins when clinicians fail to speak up in crucial situations\" (Tracy & O'Grady, 2018). It may have been less awkward for Jessica to just write the prescription, but she handled the situation correctly by directly telling the family member no. Not only can it be an ethical problem, writing prescriptions and providing care to individuals that are not established patients, can cost the Nurse Practitioner and company money. \nAmerica Reframed.

As I continued my weekly studies, I began to be more intentional when reading articles, watching the news, and strolling social media. I looked for the influence of social media in politics and representation of groups as well as the treatment of groups in news coverage… especially during the week everything took place on the capitol. I now pay attention to framing by media outlets. I will honestly admit that I did not know much of anything about qualitative, textual, or rhetorical methods.\nMedia advertisement is another aspect that I look at more intentionally now. “Ethnic-media planning oftentimes is done without the context of the general- or mass-market plan; instead, the primary focus is on ethnic media properties and content (Adweek, 2001). This suggests that some advertisers and their media agencies may place less value on or forgo ethnic segmentation.” (James and Lindsey-Warren, 2018)\n\n Zackery -Re: Topic 8 DQ 1\n\nGRowing up during the time before the internet, I remember when having computer in school was a privilige. If you got to use, you earned the right to play a game on it, and they were very basic. I look at technology today, and we have miniture computers in everyone's hand. I find this simply fascinating. I know that some people could care less, but I think the future is completely unfathomable at this point. The growth of media has been no different. For me, I never considered how politicians interact with social media. That was the eye-opening part of the course for me. I always new things regarding how social media is utilized by everyday \"common\" folks, as some owuld say. I have been aware of celebrity usage to suede others to see their point. One of the biggest movements through social media that involved a celebrity start was the Me Too! movement. Movements like this might not have been possible before the internet existed. But politicians using the internet to spread their messages was an eye-opener. I always thought of most politicians as being \"too-old\" to use the internet. I figured they had someone doing it for them. But I uncovered that many politicians don't want someone else speaking for them all the time. I know there are writers and all, but the interaction, outside of mainstream news media was new to me. And to be quite frank, I am not sure why it surprised me to discover this, because it shouldn't have been that surprising to see politicans use effective communication means.\n\n Elizabeth Re: Topic 8 DQ 1\n\nTopic 8 DQ1\nDuring the process of this course, I learned about media literacy. Honestly, I did not pay attention to how people use positive and negative media, can access and be critically evaluate, create or manipulate media, and about qualitative, textual, or rhetorical methods. Maybe because I use it as a personal or private message. Learn about the media messages and the experience of the different cultures with the same media is very impressive. Each question, comment, and example you post is good work to build a new point of view about media. According to Hooker (2019) “Creating this literacy doesn’t happen without the right tools, teachers, leaders, and mindsets when it comes to using all of this “media” in our world” (p12).\nMedia change in history now in this era we have new media changes continuously since it is constantly modified and redefined by the interaction between the creative uses of the masses, emerging technology, cultural changes. Media have a greater influence on us as we get younger or older. Choice of clothing, music, TV, social profile, the language we use is heavily influenced by this characteristic. Understand the influence of micro-cultures in media and the impact of stereotypes on audiences and their effects. According to Kunst (2020), “Assessing the source credibility and argument quality of a message influences whether recipients will accept or reject a message” (p.2)",":slug6":"week-8-discussion-responses-com",":category6":"Education homework help",":tag6":"com",":title7":"Marketing: Business & Finance homework help - business 2",":excerpt7":"The global coronavirus outbreak has seriously impacted the tourism and hospitality industries in Singapore.

Review your thesis statement and research you gathered in Weeks 1 and 2 before beginning. Be sure to note any feedback from your instructor about changes you might want to consider.\n\n\nThere are different approaches to preparing a draft, so feel free to explore what works best for you. You may wish to start by creating an outline that you can refer to as you compose your draft. An outline also gives you an opportunity to record notes to yourself on where to flesh out ideas; you can use this as a reference for later revisions. The Creating an Outline document from the Center for Writing Excellence includes a sample outline. Other approaches to preparing your draft include: writing it from start to finish, writing the body or sections individually, and then compiling and adding connections, starting by writing what intrigues you most about the topic. These strategies are meant to help you get started on your paper but remember to revise so that you have a complete draft to submit. Keep in mind that only the draft will be required for submission in this assignment. You do not have to submit your outline or notes.\n\n\nComplete the following as you prepare your rough draft:\n\nVisit the APA Templates page from the Center for Writing Excellence and select the appropriate template.\nComplete the title page information with your details and original title.\nUnderline or bold the thesis statement within your introduction paragraph.\nInclude direct quotes or paraphrased information from the research you gathered in Week 2 (3 pieces of cited evidence, 1 of which is peer-reviewed). Refer to “Paraphrase: Write It in Your Own Words” from the Purdue Online Writing Lab for assistance.\nInclude a References page with citations formatted according to APA guidelines on the last page of your essay. Each cited source should have 1 reference within the paper.\nUse a grammar checking tool from the Center for Writing Excellence to review your work for errors and make corrections as needed. \nSubmit your rough draft.\n\n\n***Jen's Helpful Hints***\n\n\n\nYou should have five paragraphs. The first is an introduction that ends in your thesis statement. The next three are body paragraphs, each of which connects to one of the supporting ideas in your thesis statement. The last is a conclusion paragraph that sums up your entire essay. How many paragraphs do you have?\nHave I approved your thesis statement? If not, message me so we can fix it. A poor thesis statement can derail the entire essay.\nEach body paragraph needs a topic sentence (not a question), at least one citation for supporting evidence, and a concluding sentence (also not a question).\nThe numbers listed on the APA templates refer to the course number, not the word count. Since this is ENG/200, you want to use APA Paper Template: 100-299.\nThe word count includes the essay only; the title and reference pages are not included. (Note: The final essay should be no more than 750 words; please don't submit a 2,000-word draft.)\nBefore you submit, take a moment to ignore the words and just look at your paper compared to the APA template. Is your spacing the same? Are your references formatted with a hanging indent? Are your headings the same? What about your title page--does it look the same? Formatting sometimes changes when you start typing into the template, so make sure it all looks right before you hand it in. Pay attention to things like font style, size, and type; compare your use of bold or italics to the template. If the template text is not italicized, yours shouldn't be, either.",":slug18":"rough-draft-school",":category18":"Education homework help",":tag18":"school",":title19":"Week 8 assignment - python",":excerpt19":"You will complete this assignment in Python 3.x.

Planning and organizing is they two I use most. Planning helps to determine which steps are necessary to implement goals and what resources are needed. I use this when compiling my workload and determining items needed to complete the job. I also tend to categorize long term assignment and short-term assignments. Organizing goes hand in hand with planning. It is generally the process by which the plans are moved closer to realization. When I organize my plans, I start by prioritizing important keynote items as well as assignments that need a quick return. When it comes to leading the focus is on managing people such as individual employees, teams and groups rather than tasks. I plan on focusing on my groups personal strengths in order to achieve optimal greatness. In this case I would be open to the second perspective on marketing. Controlling process of evaluating the execution of the plan and making adjustments to ensure that the organizational goal is achieved. Overseeing is how I would describe this. \nAdam post\nThe four steps are planning, organizing ,leading and controlling. In these key factor's though they are all important in being successful, I find planning is the most important. This to me is the foundation in which all your work is based on. Without proper planning the three following will fail. In my daily routine as a supervisor I come in an hour early and plan for the next twelve hours. I try to work out all the what if's and what might be. If planned right it makes my job so much easier for the next three stages. If i miss or fail at my planning for the day, I feel like I'm chasing myself and wondering where the time has went. Somewhere in there controlling takes affect on all that you do as well. The worst feeling as being a supervisor is when you loose control of the plant. Once gone it seems like it spreads like wild fire, everyone forgets what there doing, sometimes I wonder how they even tie their shoes in the morning. But being under control and putting one fire out at a time makes it all the easier to put things back into place. Doing this is by using your leadership skills and organization.\n\n\nIn response to Caitlin, comment on facts about the normal distribution Caitlin have posted, supporting your response by explaining why it captures your interest or describing how the principle can be applied in psychology and/or everyday life.\nCaitlin post\nWhile reading this week's chapter, what stood out to be is the 68-97-99.7 rule. I think it is interesting how rarely the standard deviation will be within 4. When looking at the visual of this charts with the \"bell\" shape, it actually reminded me of charts we have seen recently with the current COVID pandemic. I kept hearing the term \"flattening the curve\" in reference to slowing down the spread of this virus. While researching a connection between the COVID virus data and normal distribution, I came across an article on path.org that states that \"daily deaths per population will follow a normal distribution (a bell curve) which they fit to mortality data and social distance data from each state in the United States. This type of model can help estimate the timing and magnitude of the peak to support hospital provision planning\" (Volbrecht & Slater, 2020). Unfortunately, with the growing number of cases, the virus spread no longer seems to be following normal distribution, but hopefully now with the production of a vaccine, we will start to see the numbers go down.",":slug10":"need-asap-assignment-help",":category10":"Psychology homework help",":tag10":"Assignment help",":title11":"ENG 1272 MOD 1 Q&A - eng",":excerpt11":"Read and Write answers to the following assignments from the book Miller-Cochran, S.

As a teacher you will be presented with many situations that require a quick decision. You will need to consider how you can avoid potential ethical violations while still supporting the needs of your students. You will analyze case study scenarios and apply the Principles of Professional Conduct of the Education Profession of Florida and the Code of Ethics in written reflection format.\nDirections: You will be presented with a set of 20 scenarios that represent potential ethical conflicts. You need to describe what you would do in each situation by answering three general questions. The product is a report that answers the questions for each scenario and describes how you would react if you were faced with the decision to be made.\n1. For each of the scenarios provided, answer the following questions:\n· Briefly discuss the purpose of Florida’s Code of Ethics and Principles of Professional Conduct as it relates to your major/discipline/program of study.\n· Determine if there is a potential violation of the Principles of Professional Conduct, and, if so, which principle(s) are at risk in this scenario and why? \n· Identify statutory grounds/procedures for disciplinary action, the penalties that can be imposed by the Educational Practices Commission against a certificate holder, and the appeals process available to the individual if applicable.\n· What would you actually say to the parties involved that shows that you are responsible, dependable, and concerned about your students? Or what precautions would you take to protect yourself and your students? (Write a scripted response or a procedure/strategy.) \n· In a scenario that requires you to respond verbally, assume that your first response is not \"accepted\" by the party involved' and he/she tries to convince you to do what he/she wants you to do. What would you say next? (State what you think the person would say to convince you to do what he/she wants, and write your second scripted response.)\n2. You are responsible for analyzing and writing about the odd numbered scenarios #1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19. We will discuss the even numbered scenarios in class.\n3. Remember that this task will be scored. Although there are some activities in which it is acceptable for you to share work with other pre-service teachers; this one must be completed alone.\n4. Use the following web pages to complete this assignment:\nhttp://www.fldoe.org/edstandards/code_of_ethics.asp\nThe Code of Ethics and the Principles of Professional Conduct of the Education Profession in Florida\nSCENARIOS\n1 Money: As the band pre-service teacher, you are in charge of collecting monies from student sales of chocolate bars. The students are counting on this sale to go on a field trip. You are being asked to be responsible for about $ 1,000. What do you do?\n1. Advice: One of your students shows up alone at your home and wants to discuss a situation from school. He claims that a gang is bullying him and he can't tell at school or he'll be attacked. He has several bruises. That's why he came to your house. What do you do?\n2. Alcohol: During an over-night field trip with students, one of the chaperones brings a cooler of alcoholic beverages to share after the students go to bed. You check the field manual, which does not mention alcohol, but you are not sure if you are responsible for the students after they go to sleep. You would sure like one glass of wine or bottle of beer. What do you do?\n3. Rights: One of your students tells you that he/she is LGBTQ. The student confession conflicts with your own personal and religious beliefs, and makes you uncomfortable. The student wants to talk to you for guidance, because the student is having trouble \"fitting in.\" The student is crying. What do you do?\n4. The Press: Your principal is running for superintendent and a local reporter asks your opinion about the principal. (Assume two different scenarios here. In the first you think the principal is excellent; in the second you think the principal is incompetent.) What do you say to the public?\n5. Videos: Your students have worked hard preparing for an examination, and they are asking that you reward them by showing the movie Bad Teacher during class time. One of them has rented it for you and shows up in class with it. What do you do?\n6. Internet Pornography: Another pre-service teacher sends you e-mail containing funny but pornographic cartoons on the school e-mail server. What do you do?\n7. Collegiality: You become aware of a possible moral/ethical problem involving a colleague, but you have no proof and you are not directly a witness. What do you do?\n8. Public Role: You are a member of a civic group, club, church, or organization, and you are asked to speak representing that group on a controversial matter as a teacher. In your role as a teacher what do you do?\n9. Classroom Policies: You have a new student who is diabetic. You have a rule posted at the front of the class that says, \"No food in class.\" Another student catches the new student eating candy in class and tells you. What do you do? What do you say to the student who told you? \n10. Equal Opportunity: There is a state drama contest and you are the advisor for the drama team. You have a population of mostly Hispanic and Black students in your school and club. This year's selection for the contest is a scene from Shakespeare. You need six parts and have eight majority White Non-Hispanic students in the club. You are sure that pronunciation is one of the major criteria for judging. How do you pick the parts?\n11. Academic Dishonesty: Your students are talking with each other about an FSA administration given the previous day, and you hear them mention that your colleague who was proctoring the examination gave several students \"clues\" that assisted them in answering some questions. What do you do?\n12. Self‑Competing and Personal Crisis: You have always had a normal life, but after the death of your brother in a car accident, you can't help dwelling on how short life can be. You have no energy for teaching and go home and sleep all afternoon. You don't grade papers or make lesson plans. A psychologist tells you that you are depressed. Your annual review is coming up, and you're afraid of a bad report. What do you do?\n13. Due Process: You attend a football game at your school, and sit beside some students in your science class who have a bad reputation. When you start to leave, you notice your wallet is missing and you're sure you had it when you sat down. You're sure the students took your wallet, but they left early. What do you do?\n14. Free Speech and Equity in the Classroom: Your eighth grade class is studying earth science. You assign the class a science fair project with grading criteria. They are supposed to set up a poster display on a project related to the course content. One student comes in on display day and sets up a religious scene of God creating the world in seven days. You explain to the student that the display isn't consistent with the criteria ‑ it's not from a topic in the book. The student insists that his parents approved the topic after reading the science book and encouraged the project. Another student doesn't have a project. He is from a very low SES family. How do you grade the two students?\n15. Zero Tolerance: After a shooting, your district passes a strict regulation: weapons of any kind at school will result in expulsion for the rest of the year ‑ no exceptions. Several letters are sent home and the students are given assemblies where examples of knives, guns, and other weapons are displayed. You have a third grader, normally a good student, who shows you a bullet and asks you what it is ... he doesn't seem to know. He says he found it. You're afraid that turning him in will result in expulsion. What do you do?\n16. Supervisor Interactions: Your school has an assistant principal who constantly makes \"adult comments\", dresses provocatively and, occasionally, winks or waves at you. This makes you uncomfortable but nobody else seems to mind. You report to this AP for an annual review and for permission for several educational requests. Do you say something to her, \"go over her head\" to the principal, ignore her, or file a complaint?\n17. Student Rights: A student is absent from school every Monday for several weeks. You ask about it, because the student will soon be in violation of the district attendance policy. The policy states that students are to receive a failing grade if they miss more than ten days a semester. The student typically completes all work despite the absences. You ask the student why he is absent so often. He explains that his parents are divorced and Monday is the only day the court allows visitation with his father. His father helps him with schoolwork, but he lives too far away for the student to come to school. The parent and child ask for a waiver of the school attendance policy. What can you do?\n18. Confidentiality: You are in the pre-service teachers' lounge and cannot help but overhear several other pre-service teachers discussing student performance on examinations, including student names and scores. The pre-service teachers' lounge is not very private; office personnel wander in to get coffee, and the door often stands open even though students pass by regularly and can overhear anything said. Should you say anything to the talkative pre-service teachers?\n19. Academic Freedom: You teach high school social studies. The School Improvement Team decides your class would be perfect for the new sex education program. You don't think it's part of social studies, don't agree with the sex education curriculum, and have no training in the topic. The principal says that training will be provided, \"everything fits in social studies\", and social studies is not on the FSA, so you're the one to teach it. What do you do?\nFor your School of Education Portfolio Reflection, use the following to guide you in writing your reflection for this assignment:\n· For whom did you develop and/or implement the artifact (# students/ grade/age/ subject/classroom setting/LEP/ESE)?\n· What theory/concepts/best practices did you use to develop and/ or implement \n the artifact?\n· What did your students learn, or what will they learn as result of the artifact being implemented / utilized by you?\n· What did you learn as a result of creating/implementing the artifact?\n· What would you do to improve the artifact and student learning? \n· How did the assignment address the FEAP?",":slug14":"analysis-of-dilemma-analysis",":category14":"Education homework help",":tag14":"Analysis",":title15":"Case Brief - business",":excerpt15":"Module 1 - Politics & Power / Conflict & Negotiations - \"Thomas Green\"\nGeneral Theme:  Organizational Politics & Power ",":body15":"Module 1 - Politics & Power / Conflict & Negotiations - \"Thomas Green\"\nGeneral Theme:  Organizational Politics & Power / Conflict & Negotiations\nCase Name:  Thomas Green:  Power, Office Politics, and a Career in Crisis\nPlease see attached Case Brief Checklist for assignment details. \nMust be professionally written per attached Grading Rubric. \nMUST include supporting evidence. \nI have attached all documents needed to prepare the Case Brief. \nThis is also a group assignment. \nThe following links will help with more information for a brief.",":slug15":"case-brief-business",":category15":"Business & Finance homework help",":tag15":"business",":title16":"DOCX 9000.

These dilemmas can range from accepting a free cup of coffee from a business owner to being offered a bribe by a suspect. In some situations, officers have to make a decision in haste that could affect the rest of their career and personal life. Undercover officers face additional ethical dilemmas due to the nature of undercover work. It is crucial that officers are educated about and reminded from time to time of the Oath they took when hired.\n\nPolice officers have a code of ethics they agree to uphold when they are sworn in. The IACP has a code of ethics that law enforcement agencies have adopted. This organization also encourages on-going ethics training.\n\nYour task for this assignment is to address the following issues:\n\nAre there any changes you would make to the IACP Oath? Why or why not?\n\nCompare and contrast the IACP Oath and the oath of your local police department?

This activity will serve several purposes:\n\nIt will help you clarify areas to focus on this semester.\nIt will help me best tailor this semester to your needs. It is helpful for me to know what skills you are bringing with you to the beginning of the semester as well as some of the challenges you face.\nIt will serve as a foundational piece in your end-of-the-semester portfolio. As part of the portfolio task, you will need to articulate the progress you have made throughout the course.

Describe some of the aspects of writing that you are good at and/or that you enjoy.\nWhat are your weaknesses in writing? What do you struggle with?\nDescribe the physical conditions (see examples below) under which you produce your best writing.\n    \nDuring what part of the day do you find it easiest/most enjoyable to write?\nDo you prefer to write with a computer or with pen/pencil and paper?\nDo you require silence while writing, or do you prefer to have background noise or listen to music?\n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\nPART 2: Addressing the Course SLOs\nBelow you will find a list of outcomes that you will achieve by the end of the semester.

For example, many current projects use the Agile SDLC and build requirements based on user-story format. A user story is essentially a use case that describes how a specific user would interact with a system. An example of a user story tied to a customer using an ATM might be, “As a customer of the bank, I need to be able to access my account from an ATM to understand balances across all of my accounts.”\nWhat are the attributes that comprise a quality user story, and why are these attributes necessary?

Depending on the SDLC applied, requirements can be written in different forms. For example, some requirements will be very technically focused (technical requirements) and are written in a manner that dictates what a stakeholder expects the system to accomplish. Another approach taken, often with Agile-run projects, is to create a user story. A user story focuses on different types of system users and outlines more of a workflow that organizations expect.\n\n\nReview the Wk 2 Discussion - Project Requirements about what are considered well-written requirements.\n\n\nThe WeLoveVideo, Inc. project team met with the business owners last week in a structured requirements-gathering meeting. In this meeting, they discussed that the requirements should focus on certain users, such as customer support representatives and inside-sales representatives, as well as be geared toward the system supporting the job function.\n\n\nCreate 15 to 20 system requirements based on the scope of the project discussed in the requirements meeting.

These students interacted with approximately four million administrators and faculty and staff members in a diversity of settings. Most of these students will easily transition into a life of academics and social interactions. For others, insults, aggressions, and lack of inclusion are a reality; and these experiences will shape their interactions and perceptions . . . on the challenges facing the nation and world and considering the role that post-secondary education plays in improving civil discourse nationally and creating safe spaces for dialogue and personal growth. (p. 361)\nMorris (2016) goes on to argue:\nFirst, [we must] identify resources to support conversations around civil discourse, social justice, and inclusion. Could we individually and collectively in every department, college, and administrative unit resolve to make a difference—to role-model and ask our students to be kind, show compassion, be inclusive and fair, and extend a hand of friendship? Maybe our academic words, like social justice, just do not resonate. Perhaps people forget that words have power and can cause long-lasting pain or can provide encouragement. While we may study and advocate for equity, perhaps we should say that this campus and my class will discuss challenging topics; but we will be characterized by the following values: to listen, to reflect, to show compassion, to think critically, and to care about this community of learners. I know: it sounds like Robert Fulghum’s All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten (1988). However, sometimes simple guidelines work best. (p. 361)\nUse your Critical Thinking text to quickly review the following:\n\nChapter 14, \"Develop As an Ethical Reasoner,\" pages 345–365.\nIf you did not complete the Blooming Park: Ethics, Diversity, and Personnel Selection simulation last week, complete it now to begin work on the interviews relevant to your organization: P–12 education, higher education, business or corporate, or military. This activity will give you the opportunity to grapple with the ethical questions that frequently arise in professional contexts, which will be the focus of your assignment this week.\nDiversity and Multiculturalism\nDiversity in all organization settings can take many forms. We may consider differences across many criteria, including the following:\n\nEthnicity.\nEthnic identity.\nGender.\nGender identity.\nCulture.\nAbility and disability.\nDevelopmental criteria.\nAge and generation.\nOther exceptionalities.\nWhen taking account of this diversity, the principles of multicultural education encourage us to acknowledge differences, addressing the reality of each person's experience and seeking the best possible outcomes for all.\nThis week, you are asked how the diversity of the constituencies you serve within your organization need to be considered when planning and implementing education programming. Theories in the fields of diversity and multicultural education indicate that an important role of educators is to plan for and implement education practices that recognize the diverse needs of the people they serve. \nUse the Capella library to read the following:\n\nBanks, J.

We can point to perceived differences between people and cultures; however, that is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg, ignoring the effects of those differences in a given context. Additionally, focus on ethical behavior, diversity, and civil discourse usually requires value comparisons and judgments, rather than a one-side-versus-the-other approach. For additional information on these concepts and how they tie into the assignment, see the Week 7 Assignment Background Information [PDF] document.\nIn the context of the field of education, the effects of ethical behavior, diversity, and civil discourse on individuals and organizations are impossible to ignore. The challenges of adopting a broad view of difference and creating an equitable learning experience for all whom we lead are many, and they are not easily met. However, the professional literature of the field is a rich resource of tools, research, and practical experience and application.\nFor this assignment, you will review the literature related to ethical behavior, diversity, and civil discourse in the context of your particular focus and specialization and choose one main concern for each of these domains to analyze in the literature review section of your paper. You will apply the skills you started building in the Literature Review assignment in Week 4. Similar to what you did previously, but focused now on the challenges relevant to these domains and inherent to your specialization, you will research and review scholarly, peer-reviewed literature. Going one step further, you will then choose and explain the main challenges in your specialization, as suggested by your review. Note that you are writing a condensed literature review for this assignment.\nReminders\nNote that:\n\nThe literature that you will select and discuss in this assignment is totally distinct from those sources that you searched and discussed in your Week 4 Literature Review assignment, but the skills you employed in that assignment will apply here.\nWriting a literature review is a key part of academic work. A literature review is a piece of writing that describes what has been learned about a topic through previous research efforts. A literature review is essentially a report on work previously done in a field, to show an understanding of the context for your own writing. A literature review is not a summary of individual sources in a list, such as in the form of an annotated bibliography. Rather, the literature review paraphrases the findings from the scholarly readings you selected. You will seek the key themes from the different sources, and you will use in-text citations to support the information you learned from the scholarly readings.\nUse Academic Writer for guidance in citing sources and formatting your paper in proper APA style. See the Evidence and APA section of the Writing Center for instructions on accessing and using Academic Writer. \nInstructions\nBefore you begin your paper, examine the grading criteria in the scoring guide. \n\nUse the Sample Course Paper Template [DOCX] as a guide for formatting and organizing your course papers.\nUse the Week 7 Writing Revision Matrix [DOCX] template to address feedback you receive on this assignment from your instructor. Refer to the Writing Revision Matrix instructions below for further information. \nPaper Organization\nStart with a title page and organize your paper with the following guidelines:\n\nTitle page: Include a title page with the following title: Ethical Behavior, Diversity, Civil Discourse, and [Name of Your Specialization]: A Literature Review.\nIntroduction: The opening content should directly follow the title of the paper (repeated from the title page). In this section, list or summarize the issues you selected from the literature related to ethical behavior, diversity, and civil discourse, and provide a summary or road map for the content included in your paper.\nOverview of issues: Begin the body of your paper with an overview of the issues related to ethical behavior, diversity, and civil discourse you chose for this review. Describe connections among these issues and their significance to education. Write in third person and include literature support.\nDiversity issue related to specialization: Provide detailed descriptions and examples of how the issues you chose to review specifically relate to your specialization. Write in third person and include literature support. \nEthical behavior issue related to specialization: Provide detailed descriptions and examples of how the issue you chose to review specifically relates to your specialization. Write in third person and include literature support.\nCivil discourse issue related to specialization: Provide detailed descriptions and examples of how the issue you chose to review specifically relates to your specialization. Write in third person and include literature support.\nReview of the literature: The literature review should include a minimum of five references from peer-reviewed journal articles related to your education specialization. Analyze this scholarly literature, focusing on the connections between your educational specialization and the issues of ethical behavior, diversity, and civil discourse you chose to research. Continue writing in third person and cite the literature for support.\nConclusion: Your conclusion should emphasize the main themes in your paper and provide a synthesis of the literature reviewed, with special attention to the connections and relationships among the issues you chose to research and your educational specialization.\nReferences: Include a minimum of five different scholarly, peer-reviewed journals (related to your field of specialization) that are also cited in the paper. Your citations must have references and your references should be included within your paper as in-text citations.\n\nResearch Guides\nRefer to the EdD Program Library Research Guide and the EdS Program Library Research Guide for guidance on gathering scholarly resources. The topical tabs offer more advice for each specialization. If you have questions about gathering articles or other materials, see the Library Help page for personal assistance through chat, e-mail, and phone.\nAdditional Requirements\nIn addition to the requirements outlined above, your assignment should meet the following:\n\nAssignment template: Use the Sample Course Paper Template [DOCX] for the assignment.\nWritten communication: Written communication is free of errors that detract from the overall message.\nSources: A minimum five scholarly, peer-reviewed sources from at least three different scholarly journals for your field or specialization.\nAPA formatting: Follow current APA style and formatting for in-text citations. For more information on the APA guidelines for in-text citations, go to Academic Writer and use the Learn tab to find the Quick Guides on Citing Sources and Paper Format and Organization.\n        \nInclude a title page with the following title: Ethical Behavior, Diversity, Civil Discourse, and [Name of Your Specialization]: A Literature Review.\n\n\nLength: The paper should be 7–10 pages, in addition to the title page and references page.\nFont and font size: Times New Roman, 12 point.\nPortfolio Prompt: Consider saving this assignment to your ePortfolio. The work you submit for this course will only be retrievable for a limited time, and you may want or need to access these assignments in the future.\nSubmit your paper as a Word document in the Week 7 assignment area.",":slug10":"week-7-ethical-behavior-diversity-and-civil-discourse-edd",":category10":"Education homework help",":tag10":"EDD",":title11":"case study: Business & Finance homework help - APA 20",":excerpt11":"Objectives\n\nIdentify potential risks and disruptions in global supply chain networks\nRecommend operations strategies to ",":body11":"Objectives\n\nIdentify potential risks and disruptions in global supply chain networks\nRecommend operations strategies to manage supply chain risks and disruptions\nEvaluate companies’ strategies in dealing with supply chain risks\n\nRequired Materials\nAggarwal, S., & Srivastava, M.

Add some facts with at least 2 citations APA Format\nDiscussion: Community-Acquired Pneumonia\n                                                                                                              Case  Study\nHH is a 68-yr M who has been admitted to the medical ward with community-acquired pneumonia for the past three days. His PMH is\nsignificant for COPD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He remains on empiric antibiotics, including ceftriaxone 1 g IV q day (day 3) and\nazithromycin 500 mg IV q day (day 3). Since admission, his clinical status has improved, with decreased oxygen requirements. He is not tolerating a\ndiet at this time, complaining of nausea and vomiting. Ht: 5'8\" Wt: 89 kg Allergies: Penicillin (rash).\nDiagnosis: Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)\nCAP is the term used to describe an acute infection of the lungs that develops outside the hospital setting by an immune-competent\nindividual who has not been recently hospitalized (Shoar & Musher, 2020). Adults with CAP typically present with cough, fever, sputum production or\nshortness of breath, oxygen desaturation, confusion, leukocytosis or leukopenia, and pleuritic chest pain, along with the presence of an acute\ninfiltrate on the chest radiograph (Shoar & Musher, 2020).\nAntibiotic suggested for CAP's empiric treatment is based on agents useful against CAP's major treatable bacterial causes. The bacterial\npathogens responsible for CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Haemophilus\ninfluenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, and Moraxella catarrhalis (Metlay et al., 2019).\nThe patient is on right treatment, his clinical status has improved, with decreased oxygen requirement. Recommended treatment plan for\npatients with comorbidities such as alcoholism, COPD, post influenza, asplenia, diabetes mellitus, lung/liver/renal diseases include: Combination\nof a beta-lactam (ceftriaxone 1 g IV q24h or cefotaxime 1 g IV q8h or ceftaroline 600 mg IV q12h) plus azithromycin 500 mg IV q24h (Donovan, 2019).\nThe therapy duration is a minimum of 5 days. The patient needs to be afebrile for 48-72 hours, controlled blood pressure, adequate oral intake, and\nroom air oxygen saturation of greater than 90% and treatment duration can be extended if symptoms are not recovered in some cases (Donovan,\n2019).\n             In this case, the patient symptoms are improving, his oxygen requirement is decreased, but he is not tolerating a diet at this time,\ncomplaining of nausea and vomiting. The patient received antibiotics for three days, so antibiotics need to be continued. With appropriate antibiotic\ntherapy, some improvement in the patient's clinical course is usually seen within 48 to 72 hours (File, 2020).\n                                                                                     Health Needs and Treatment Regimen\nThe patient is not tolerating diet and complaining of nausea and vomiting. Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations such as nausea, vomiting,\nand diarrhea are considered possibly due to adverse drug (antibiotics) effects (Lin et al., 2009). Changing the antibiotic can help patients to avoid\nthese side effects. Levofloxacin 750 mg IV or PO q24h is a recommended dose to treat CAP patients (Donovan, 2019).\n              Levofloxacin possesses greater bioavailability and a longer serum half-life that allows for rapid step-down from intravenous administration\nto oral therapy, minimizing unnecessary hospitalization, which may decrease costs and improve patient quality of life (Lynch III et al., 2006). Several\nrandomized clinical trials to evaluate levofloxacin to treat CAP demonstrate that levofloxacin is effective and safe for CAP treatment, displaying\nrelatively mild adverse effects. Levofloxacin has much to offer in terms of bacterial eradication (Lynch III et al., 2006). The other studies also\nconcluded that monotherapy with oral levofloxacin is as effective as treatment with Ceftriaxone plus, Azithromycin combination in patients with CAP\nwho required hospitalization (Izadi et al., 2019).\n             Probiotics can be added to the treatment plan. Probiotics replenish the natural GI flora with nonpathogenic organisms. Few studies found\nprobiotics to be useful for preventing and treating antibiotic-associated diarrhea related to antibiotic treatment (Rodgers et al., 2013).\nAn antiemetic medication such as ondansetron can be added. It is a selective 5-HT3 serotonin-receptor antagonist and acts on central and\nperipheral areas to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting (Griddine & Bush, 2020).\nAs the patient is diabetic, his blood sugar needs to monitor carefully because of sickness, nausea, and vomiting. Sliding scale insulin (SSI) is\nrecommended. Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients result in adverse outcomes, including increased infection rates,\nlonger hospital length of stay, and even death. The use of oral antidiabetic treatments during hospitalization is generally not recommended because\nof their safety and efficacy and their significant risk of hypoglycemia and contraindications (Marín-Peñalver et al., 2016).\n                                                             Patient Education for the management of Their Health Needs\nThe patient needs to be educated and encouraged to use an incentive spirometer (IS). Incentive spirometry is commonly used to break up\nfluid that builds up in the lungs in people with pneumonia. IS helps to open the airways and help manage COPD symptoms (Yetman, 2020).\nThe patient needs to be educated about importance of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and influenza vaccines.\nAs per International Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease study, these vaccines decrease the risk of exacerbations in patients with\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Ely, 2018). Patients over 65 years of age are more susceptible to community-acquired pneumonia\n(CAP), and COPD patients are 20 times more prone to develop CAP (Ely, 2018). The Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults\n(CAPITA) provided evidence of the benefits of vaccinating with PCV13, which protects against 13 pneumococcal bacteria types (Ely, 2018).\n              At the time of discharge, the patient needs to be educated to continue his home medications and finish the prescription of antibiotics if\nprescribed, even if he starts to feel better. Taking the entire course of antibiotics is one way to prevent recurring and more severe infections and\ncombat antibiotic resistance (Rosenthal & Burchum, 2020).\n                                                                                                                Conclusion\n              Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common acute infections requiring hospital admission. Age is a dominant risk\nfactor, with CAP's incidence increasing markedly in patients who are over 65 years of age. Aging increases the mucosal cell surface protein\nexpression that bacteria can adhere to, enabling potential pathogens to avoid normal clearance mechanisms better. There is evidence that age\ndirectly affects innate and adaptive immunity, a process called immunosenescence, which weakens lung immunity to invading microbes (Brown,\n2012). Few behavior changes like quitting smoking and alcohol abuse and administering the vaccine can prevent or decrease CAP's severity.\nReferences\nBrown, J. S. (2012). Community-acquired pneumonia.

In 3-4 sentences, describe her original approach to reflective writing and the specific ways in which her perspective and actions changed.\nAccording to the section of the reading titled “How It Works,” what are 2 specific benefits of engaging in reflective writing? How can reflection help us become stronger and more effective writers and communicators?\nConsider which of the benefits from your response to question 2 connects the most to you and your experiences as a writer. In 4-5 sentences, explain which one(s) you feel like you’ve experienced in your own writing journey or which one(s) you feel like you could benefit the most from and why.\nOn page 200, Giles writes, “My students often resist writing about their composing processes, but it’s good for them to see and analyze how they did what they did, and it also helps me know what they were thinking when they made composing decisions.” She then goes on to explain the specific ways in which reflective writing can help not only the student, but also the instructor. According to Giles, what are at least 3 specific ways in which reflective writing can help the instructor more effectively respond to and understand student writing?\nRelatedly, is this recognition that reflective writing can help the instructor more effectively respond to their students a new idea for you, or is this an idea you had previously considered/experienced? Explain your response.\nOn page 202, Giles writes, “Teachers don’t want you to say certain things, we want you to think in certain ways.” How do you understand what she means here, and what are some specific ways that reflective writing can help us to get into the productive “habit of thinking reflectively?” (202)\nThink about your own experiences with reflective writing. These might be experiences you’ve had in school on an assignment, writing in a personal journal/diary, at your job, or somewhere else. In 5-7 sentences, describe one specific experience you’ve had with reflective writing and make at least one specific connection to something Giles writes in this article. Here, you might respond to one of the following questions:\n    \nDo your personal experiences with reflective writing agree with something Giles says? If so, what is the agreement?\nDo your personal experiences with reflective writing contradict something Giles says? If so, what is the contradiction?\nDo your personal experiences add to something Giles says, perhaps presents an additional perspective or an idea that she did not discuss? If so, what is this addition?\n\n\n\n400 words",":slug3":"reflective-writing-and-the-revision-process-quality-work",":category3":"English homework help",":tag3":"quality work",":title4":"Memo Draft help - rr",":excerpt4":"1 page \nThink of an idea you would like to see implementing in your job (e.g. a way to increase productivity, improve s",":body4":"1 page \nThink of an idea you would like to see implementing in your job (e.g. a way to increase productivity, improve service, increase business, or improve working conditions).
