# Writing CMS

This is a basic PHP CMS for academic writing websites. The CMS is created to provide targeted support for essay writing websites by identifying the common and relevant features that are required for publishing question-based websites.

For instance, this CMS focuses on websites that require to constantly publish questions in bulk instead of writing customized blog articles. Therefore, this CMS will serve you well if the websites you create do not require constant updating of individual articles.

The approach for this CMS is to establish automation on multiple websites, priority support for bulk uploading of questions, and SEO friendliness.

## Core Features
* Automatic and bulk uploading on multiple sites - Through API calls, you can upload multiple questions to one or more websites that use this CMS using this script (**Writer Toolbox** - Writing CMS API Uploading tools)[https://github.com/mwanginjuguna/writer-toolbox]. Also, you can upload questions on individual websites using csv files while signed in as admin.
* Automatic sitemap generation - Sitemaps are automatically created on every single upload and during new site setup by Admin. The site has a single sitemap.xml that is the sitemapindex listing all the sitemaps for the site. Others include page_sitemap.xml for all pages, and posts_sitemapX.xml where X is the index or number. Each posts_sitemap.xml can only have a max of 2000 urls.
* SEO friendly pages and post formats including meta tags to improve crawling and discovery.
* Order price calculator mounted on sections that users are likely to easily engage with.
* Dynamic linking to Order systems. The CMS does not explicitly require the order management system to be hosted on the same site. You only need to provide the correct link to your order system website during setup, and it will cleverly inserted to all the relevant buttons and links.
* Customize each wesbite with its unique details during setup.
